In this paper, different soil water content control levels at winter wheat growth stages are performed on Gucheng Ecological-Meteorological Integrated Observation Experiment Station of CAMS, China. Some canopy parameters, including growth conditions, dry weight, physiological parameters and hyperspectral reflectance, are measured from erecting stage to milk stage for winter wheat in 2009. The relationship between canopy parameters and soil relative moisture, canopy water content and water indices of winter wheat are established. The results show that some parameters, such as SPAD and dry weight of leaves, decrease with the increasing of soil relative moisture, while other parameters, including dry weight of caudexes, above ground dry weight, height, photosynthesis rate, intercellular CO 2 concentration, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, increase corresponding to the soil relative moisture. Obvious linear relationship between stomatal conductance and transpiration rate is established with 45 samples, which R2 reaches to 0.6152. Finally, the fitting equations between canopy water content and water indices are regressed with b5, b6 and b7 of MODIS bands. The equations are best with b7 and worst with b5.

Consistency of fixed-sized pieces of secondary structures is the easiest to approximate and we formalize it as 1-2 matching problem. Consistency of entire secondary structures is a version of set packing. We also investigate how to form a simple problem if we add the requirement that the secondary structure and the loops that connect them fit together in a metric space.

Switch requirements are particularly important in conventional VLSI where (a) a switchpoint consumes considerably more area than a wire crossing and (b) switchpoints must reside on the active surface, whereas wiring may take place on any of several wire layers. The most straight-forward, limited-bisection switching networks have switching requirements which grow as $O(N^{2p})$, similar to wiring requirements.

The effect of the thread communication methods is evaluated in a PC cluster and a cluster of PowerPC workstations with some well-accepted benchmarks. Evaluation results show that the performance of thread communication is slightly worse than that of interrupt communication when there is only one processor to run a process, but is better than that of interrupt communication when there are more than one processors in a node to run a process. The thread communication method with one sending thread and one receiving thread achieves the best performance inthethree thread communication methods.

In this paper we propose a generic component structure: several independent nodes constitute a cell; a slice of identifier space is under nodes' condominium; part of nodes in the same cell cooperatively and transparently shield the internal dynamism and structure of the cell from outsiders; this type of structure can be recursively repeated. Cells act like raw nodes in conventional DHTs and cell components can be used as bricks to construct any DHT-like systems.

However, all existing information brokerage systems view or handle query brokering and access control as two orthogonal issues: query brokering is a system issue that concerns costs and performance, while access control is a security issue that concerns information confidentiality. As a result, access control deployment strategies (in terms of where and when to do access control) and the impact of such strategies on end-to-end system performance are neglected by existing information brokerage systems. In addition, data source side access control deployment is taken-for-granted as the \"right\" thing to do. In this paper, we challenge this traditional, taken-for-granted access control deployment methodology, and argue that query brokering and access control are not two orthogonal issues because access control deployment strategies can have a significant impact on the \"whole\" system's end-to-end performance.

In this paper, we examine closely the problem of mining sequential patterns and propose a general evaluation method to assess the quality of the mined results. We propose four evaluation criteria, namely (1) recoverability, (2) the number of spurious patterns (3) the number of redundant patterns, and (4) the degree of extraneous items in the patterns, to quantitatively assess the quality of the mined results from a wide variety of synthetic datasets with varying randomness and noise levels. Recoverability, a new metric, measures how much of the underlying trend has been detected. Such an evaluation method provides a basis for comparing different models for sequential pattern mining. Furthermore, such evaluation is essential in understanding the performance of approximate solutions. In this paper, the method is employed to conduct a detailed comparison of the traditional frequent sequential pattern model with an alternative approximate pattern model based on sequence alignment. We demonstrate that the alternative approach is able to better recover the underlying patterns with little confounding information under all circumstances we examined, including those where the frequent sequential pattern model fails.</td><td>Comparative Study of Sequential Pattern Mining Models</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a583f</td><td>  Reference resolution is one of the important tasks in natural language processing.

From this characterization, we know we can establish a lower bound on layout area implied by wiring. When applying this lower bound to the design of programmable or switched networks, we are ultimately concerned for both the switching requirements and the wiring requirements. Switch requirements are particularly important in conventional VLSI where (a) a switchpoint consumes considerably more area than a wire crossing and (b) switchpoints must reside on the active surface, whereas wiring may take place on any of several wire layers. The most straight-forward, limited-bisection switching networks have switching requirements which grow as $O(N^{2p})$, similar to wiring requirements. In practice, however, this leaves switching dominating wiring. We show that there are limited-bisection networks with $O(N)$ switching growth and highlight some of the tradeoffs between wire utilization and switching, routing complexity, routing guarantees, and switch latency within this design space.</td><td>Rent's rule based switching requirements</td></tr><tr><td>53e99960b7602d97021a54a3</td><td>This paper presents a regular layout approach addressing the need of a more predictable circuit performance and DFM.

Interrupt, however, is expensive and may not be available in user-level communication protocols. This paper studies the performance of software DSMs using threads instead of interrupt for communication. We implement three thread communication methods in the JIAJIA software DSM. The first method separates a communication thread from the main thread, the second one divides the communication thread into a sending thread and a receiving thread, and the third method further splits a serving thread from the receiving thread. The effect of the thread communication methods is evaluated in a PC cluster and a cluster of PowerPC workstations with some well-accepted benchmarks. Evaluation results show that the performance of thread communication is slightly worse than that of interrupt communication when there is only one processor to run a process, but is better than that of interrupt communication when there are more than one processors in a node to run a process. The thread communication method with one sending thread and one receiving thread achieves the best performance inthethree thread communication methods. Besides, the effect of the thread communication is also related to the operating system. Analysis of the evaluation results reveals that the waiting time constitutes the major overhead of the execution, and the dominant factor that in uence waiting time is neither the interrupt overhead nor the thread switching overhead but the responsiveness of requests (i.e., whether requests can be processed and replied promptly).</td><td>Communication with Threads in Software DSMs</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a5705</td><td>In today's scenario most of the programs are interdisciplinary in nature.

The outcome of these results and other related issues have been discussed.</td><td>A Study on Relevance of Student's Attitude, Implementing an Interdisciplinary Approach in a Post Graduate Program.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["additional_stop_words = [ 'doi',\n'preprint', 'copyright', 'peer', 'reviewed', 'org', 'https', 'et', 'al', 'author', 'figure','rights',\n'reserved', 'permission', 'used', 'using', 'biorxiv', 'medrxiv', 'license', 'fig', 'fig.', 'al.', 'Elsevier',\n'PMC', 'CZI', 'www']\n\nfor w in additional_stop_words:\n    nlp.vocab[w].is_stop = True\n\n\ndef strip_html_tags(text):\n    \"\"\"remove html tags from text\"\"\"\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(text, \"html.parser\")\n    stripped_text = soup.get_text(separator=\" \")\n    return stripped_text\n\n\ndef remove_whitespace(text):\n    \"\"\"remove extra whitespaces from text\"\"\"\n    text = text.strip()\n    return \" \".join(text.split())\n\n\ndef remove_accented_chars(text):\n    \"\"\"remove accented characters from text, e.g. café\"\"\"\n    text = unidecode.unidecode(text)\n    return text\n\n\ndef expand_contractions(text):\n    \"\"\"expand shortened words, e.g. don't to do not\"\"\"\n    text = contractions.fix(text)\n    return text\n\n\ndef text_preprocessing(text, accented_chars=True, contractions=True, \n                       convert_num=True, extra_whitespace=True, \n                       lemmatization=True, lowercase=True, punctuations=True,\n                       remove_html=True, remove_num=True, special_chars=True, \n                       stop_words=True):\n    \"\"\"preprocess text with default option set to true for all steps\"\"\"\n    if remove_html == True: #remove html tags\n        text = strip_html_tags(text)\n    if extra_whitespace == True: #remove extra whitespaces\n        text = remove_whitespace(text)\n    if accented_chars == True: #remove accented characters\n        text = remove_accented_chars(text)\n    if contractions == True: #expand contractions\n        text = expand_contractions(text)\n    if lowercase == True: #convert all characters to lowercase\n        text = text.lower()\n\n    doc = nlp(text) #tokenise text\n\n    clean_text = []\n    \n    for token in doc:\n        flag = True\n        edit = token.text\n        # remove stop words\n        if stop_words == True and token.is_stop and token.pos_ != 'NUM': \n            flag = False\n        # remove punctuations\n        if punctuations == True and token.pos_ == 'PUNCT' and flag == True: \n            flag = False\n        # remove special characters\n        if special_chars == True and token.pos_ == 'SYM' and flag == True: \n            flag = False\n        # remove numbers\n        if remove_num == True and (token.pos_ == 'NUM' or token.text.isnumeric()) \\\n        and flag == True:\n            flag = False\n        # convert number words to numeric numbers\n        if convert_num == True and token.pos_ == 'NUM' and flag == True:\n            edit = w2n.word_to_num(token.text)\n        # convert tokens to base form\n        elif lemmatization == True and token.lemma_ != \"-PRON-\" and flag == True:\n            edit = token.lemma_\n        # append tokens edited and not removed to list \n        if edit != \"\" and flag == True:\n            clean_text.append(edit)        \n    return clean_text"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{"rowLimit":10000,"byteLimit":2048000},"nuid":"e39b4093-edb2-4736-897d-ff91508de26e","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"fa50b8dd-0c87-499a-9e45-a5f55d899b78","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0}],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+notebook":{"notebookName":"Project_4","dashboards":[],"notebookMetadata":{"pythonIndentUnit":4,"mostRecentlyExecutedCommandWithImplicitDF":{"commandId":3945439592120629,"dataframes":["_sqldf"]}},"language":"python","widgets":{}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
