It is especially serious in North China Plain. In this paper, different soil water content control levels at winter wheat growth stages are performed on Gucheng Ecological-Meteorological Integrated Observation Experiment Station of CAMS, China. Some canopy parameters, including growth conditions, dry weight, physiological parameters and hyperspectral reflectance, are measured from erecting stage to milk stage for winter wheat in 2009. The relationship between canopy parameters and soil relative moisture, canopy water content and water indices of winter wheat are established. The results show that some parameters, such as SPAD and dry weight of leaves, decrease with the increasing of soil relative moisture, while other parameters, including dry weight of caudexes, above ground dry weight, height, photosynthesis rate, intercellular CO 2 concentration, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, increase corresponding to the soil relative moisture. Obvious linear relationship between stomatal conductance and transpiration rate is established with 45 samples, which R2 reaches to 0.6152. Finally, the fitting equations between canopy water content and water indices are regressed with b5, b6 and b7 of MODIS bands. The equations are best with b7 and worst with b5. So the fitting equations with b7 can be used to inverse the canopy water content of winter wheat using MODIS or other remote sensing images with similar bands range to MODIS in Hebei Province. © 2011 IEEE.",[["53f45728dabfaec09f209538",null,null,null,"Peijuan Wang",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["5601754345cedb3395e59457",null,null,null,"Jiahua Zhang",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["53f38438dabfae4b34a08928",null,null,null,"Donghui Xie",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["5601754345cedb3395e5945a",null,null,null,"Yanyan Xu",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["53f43d25dabfaeecd6995149",null,null,null,"Yun Xu",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]],"10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049503",["Agronomy","Moisture","Hydrology","Environmental science","Dry weight","Water content","Stomatal conductance","Transpiration","Irrigation","Soil water","Canopy"],"","","null",["canopy parameters","canopy spectrum","different soil water content control","winter wheat","irrigation","hydrology","radiometry","moisture","indexes","vegetation","indexation","dry weight","soil moisture","water content","indexing terms","spectrum","natural disaster"],"en","0","1933","1930",null,null,"The relationship between canopy parameters and spectrum of winter wheat under different irrigations in Hebei Province.",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049503"],["53a7297d20f7420be8bd4ae7",null,null,"International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium",null,null,null,"IGARSS",null,null,null,null,"0"],"null","2011"],["53e99784b7602d9701f3e151","",[["53f46797dabfaeb22f542630",null,null,null,"Jairo Rocha",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["54328883dabfaeb4c6a8a699",null,null,null,"Theo Pavlidis",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]],"10.1109/ICDAR.1993.395663",["Intelligent character recognition","Pattern recognition","Computer science","Feature (computer vision)","Document processing","Handwriting recognition","Optical character recognition","Feature extraction","Feature (machine learning)","Artificial intelligence","Intelligent word recognition"],"","","",["handwriting recognition","prototypes","image segmentation","computer science","expert systems","knowledge base","pattern recognition","usability","optical character recognition","shape","feature extraction"],"en","17","605","602",null,["53e99cf5b7602d97025ace63","557e8a7a6fee0fe990caa63d","53e9a96cb7602d97032c459a","53e9b929b7602d9704515791","557e59ebf6678c77ea222447"],"A solution to the problem of touching and broken characters.",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.1993.395663"],["53a72a4920f7420be8bfa51b",null,null,"International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition",null,null,null,"ICDAR-1",null,null,null,null,"0"],"","1993"],["53e99784b7602d9701f3e15d","As process variations become a significant problem in deep sub-micron technology, a shift from deterministic static timing analysis to statistical static timing analysis for high-performance circuit designs could reduce the excessive conservatism that is built into current timing design methods.

We consider the spatial and path reconvergence correlations between path delays, set-up time and hold time constraints, and clock skew due to process variations. We propose a method to get the timing yield based on the delay distributions of register-to-register paths in the circuit On average, the timing yield results obtained by our approach have average errors of less than 1.0% in comparison with Monte Carlo simulation.

Despite this interest, software agents are not yet widespread due to many reasons, one of which is the heavy programming work that has to be done in order to create efficient and effective agent systems, particularly from the point of view of agents' characteristics, such as autonomy and deliberation on one hand, and integration with other technologies and applications on the other. While several agent platforms implement the belief-desire-intention (BDI) architecture have been proposed, most of these platforms are implemented based on existing general purpose programming languages, e.g. Java. As a consequence, this prevents the use of advanced features of the underlying programming language and the integration with new technologies and paradigms that are essential for the development of enterprise applications. Due to these limitations of the existing platforms, a new BDI distributed agent platform design and implementation is proposed in this paper. The CloudNetBDI platform prototype is compliant with the specifications of the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) and has been implemented in the .NET framework. The CloudNetBDI platform employs the BDI model as an internal reasoning engine for its agents.

Indeed, it makes a very important contribution in the analysis of these data. It can reveal information about shared biological functions of biological macromolecules, coming from several different organisms, by the identification of patterns that are shared by structures related to these macromolecules. These patterns, which have been conserved during evolution, often play an important structural and/or functional role, and consequently, shed light on the mechanisms and the biological processes in which these macromolecules participate. Pattern finding in biomolecular data is also used in evolutionary studies, in order to analyze relationships that exist between species and establish if two, or several, biological macromolecules are homologous and to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree that links them to their common biological ancestor. On the other hand, with the new sequencing technologies, the number of biological sequences in databases is increasing exponentially. In addition, the lengths of these sequences are large. Hence, the finding of patterns in such databases requires the development of fast, low memory requirement and highperformance techniques and approaches. This issue contains very interesting papers that deal with pattern finding in Computational Molecular Biology.",[["53f46210dabfaedf43634cba",null,null,"5b86c21ae1cd8e14a39e6b14","El Mohajir, Mohammed",null,null,null,null,"FSDM, USMBA, Fez, Morocco|c|",null,"5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5b7",null,null,null],[null,null,null,null,"Begdouri, Ahlame",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["560175f745cedb3395e5a536",null,null,null,"El Mohajir, Badreddine",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["560175f745cedb3395e5a539",null,null,null,"Zarghili, Arsalane",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]],"10.1109/CIST.2012.6388046",null,"978-1-4673-2724-4","2212-3431","Supplement 1",["Political Economy","Social Choice","Historical Perspective","Welfare Economic","50th Anniversary"],"en","6","","",null,null,"Foreword.",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CIST.2012.6388046","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6388046","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22998934?report=xml&format=text","http://dx.doi.org/10.2165/1159571-S0-000000000-00000","http://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/1159571-S0-000000000-00000","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27008821?report=xml&format=text","http://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e100-a_1_1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WINCOM.2016.7777230","https://doi.org/10.23919/ConTEL.2017.8000005","https://doi.org/10.1587/transfun.E101.A.1323","http://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e101-a_9_1323","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11786-018-0371-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-002-1007-2","https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00125-002-1007-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1024856009040010","https://link.springer.com/10.1134/S1024856009040010","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0967-x","https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13280-017-0967-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00355-005-0001-2","https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00355-005-0001-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-005-4244-9","https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10584-005-4244-9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00148585","https://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF00148585"],["53a7314420f7420be8d31c79",null,null,null,null,null,null,"IEICE Transactions",null,null,null,null,"11"],"1","2012"],["53e99784b7602d9701f3f8c3",null,[["53f4d429dabfaeedd3781ccf",null,null,"5b86b6cfe1cd8e14a34d092b","J.R.

in the world. It is especially serious in North China Plain. In this paper, different soil water content control levels at winter wheat growth stages are performed on Gucheng Ecological-Meteorological Integrated Observation Experiment Station of CAMS, China. Some canopy parameters, including growth conditions, dry weight, physiological parameters and hyperspectral reflectance, are measured from erecting stage to milk stage for winter wheat in 2009. The relationship between canopy parameters and soil relative moisture, canopy water content and water indices of winter wheat are established. The results show that some parameters, such as SPAD and dry weight of leaves, decrease with the increasing of soil relative moisture, while other parameters, including dry weight of caudexes, above ground dry weight, height, photosynthesis rate, intercellular CO 2 concentration, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, increase corresponding to the soil relative moisture. Obvious linear relationship between stomatal conductance and transpiration rate is established with 45 samples, which R2 reaches to 0.6152. Finally, the fitting equations between canopy water content and water indices are regressed with b5, b6 and b7 of MODIS bands. The equations are best with b7 and worst with b5. So the fitting equations with b7 can be used to inverse the canopy water content of winter wheat using MODIS or other remote sensing images with similar bands range to MODIS in Hebei Province. © 2011 IEEE.</td><td>List(List(53f45728dabfaec09f209538, null, null, null, Peijuan Wang, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(5601754345cedb3395e59457, null, null, null, Jiahua Zhang, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f38438dabfae4b34a08928, null, null, null, Donghui Xie, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(5601754345cedb3395e5945a, null, null, null, Yanyan Xu, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f43d25dabfaeecd6995149, null, null, null, Yun Xu, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049503</td><td>List(Agronomy, Moisture, Hydrology, Environmental science, Dry weight, Water content, Stomatal conductance, Transpiration, Irrigation, Soil water, Canopy)</td><td></td><td></td><td>null</td><td>List(canopy parameters, canopy spectrum, different soil water content control, winter wheat, irrigation, hydrology, radiometry, moisture, indexes, vegetation, indexation, dry weight, soil moisture, water content, indexing terms, spectrum, natural disaster)</td><td>en</td><td>0</td><td>1933</td><td>1930</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>The relationship between canopy parameters and spectrum of winter wheat under different irrigations in Hebei Province.</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049503)</td><td>List(53a7297d20f7420be8bd4ae7, null, null, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, null, null, null, IGARSS, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>null</td><td>2011</td></tr><tr><td>53e99784b7602d9701f3e151</td><td></td><td>List(List(53f46797dabfaeb22f542630, null, null, null, Jairo Rocha, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(54328883dabfaeb4c6a8a699, null, null, null, Theo Pavlidis, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1109/ICDAR.1993.395663</td><td>List(Intelligent character recognition, Pattern recognition, Computer science, Feature (computer vision), Document processing, Handwriting recognition, Optical character recognition, Feature extraction, Feature (machine learning), Artificial intelligence, Intelligent word recognition)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>List(handwriting recognition, prototypes, image segmentation, computer science, expert systems, knowledge base, pattern recognition, usability, optical character recognition, shape, feature extraction)</td><td>en</td><td>17</td><td>605</td><td>602</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e99cf5b7602d97025ace63, 557e8a7a6fee0fe990caa63d, 53e9a96cb7602d97032c459a, 53e9b929b7602d9704515791, 557e59ebf6678c77ea222447)</td><td>A solution to the problem of touching and broken characters.</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.1993.395663)</td><td>List(53a72a4920f7420be8bfa51b, null, null, International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, null, null, null, ICDAR-1, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>1993</td></tr><tr><td>53e99784b7602d9701f3e15d</td><td>As process variations become a significant problem in deep sub-micron technology, a shift from deterministic static timing analysis to statistical static timing analysis for high-performance circuit designs could reduce the excessive conservatism that is built into current timing design methods.

We consider the spatial and path reconvergence correlations between path delays, set-up time and hold time constraints, and clock skew due to process variations. We propose a method to get the timing yield based on the delay distributions of register-to-register paths in the circuit On average, the timing yield results obtained by our approach have average errors of less than 1.0% in comparison with Monte Carlo simulation. Experimental results show that shortest path variations and clock skew due to process variations have considerable impact on circuit timing, which could bias the timing yield results.

Despite this interest, software agents are not yet widespread due to many reasons, one of which is the heavy programming work that has to be done in order to create efficient and effective agent systems, particularly from the point of view of agents' characteristics, such as autonomy and deliberation on one hand, and integration with other technologies and applications on the other. While several agent platforms implement the belief-desire-intention (BDI) architecture have been proposed, most of these platforms are implemented based on existing general purpose programming languages, e.g. Java. As a consequence, this prevents the use of advanced features of the underlying programming language and the integration with new technologies and paradigms that are essential for the development of enterprise applications. Due to these limitations of the existing platforms, a new BDI distributed agent platform design and implementation is proposed in this paper. The CloudNetBDI platform prototype is compliant with the specifications of the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) and has been implemented in the .NET framework. The CloudNetBDI platform employs the BDI model as an internal reasoning engine for its agents.

Indeed, it makes a very important contribution in the analysis of these data. It can reveal information about shared biological functions of biological macromolecules, coming from several different organisms, by the identification of patterns that are shared by structures related to these macromolecules. These patterns, which have been conserved during evolution, often play an important structural and/or functional role, and consequently, shed light on the mechanisms and the biological processes in which these macromolecules participate. Pattern finding in biomolecular data is also used in evolutionary studies, in order to analyze relationships that exist between species and establish if two, or several, biological macromolecules are homologous and to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree that links them to their common biological ancestor. On the other hand, with the new sequencing technologies, the number of biological sequences in databases is increasing exponentially. In addition, the lengths of these sequences are large. Hence, the finding of patterns in such databases requires the development of fast, low memory requirement and highperformance techniques and approaches. This issue contains very interesting papers that deal with pattern finding in Computational Molecular Biology.</td><td>List(List(53f46210dabfaedf43634cba, null, null, 5b86c21ae1cd8e14a39e6b14, El Mohajir, Mohammed, null, null, null, null, FSDM, USMBA, Fez, Morocco|c|, null, 5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5b7, null, null, null), List(null, null, null, null, Begdouri, Ahlame, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(560175f745cedb3395e5a536, null, null, null, El Mohajir, Badreddine, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(560175f745cedb3395e5a539, null, null, null, Zarghili, Arsalane, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1109/CIST.2012.6388046</td><td>null</td><td>978-1-4673-2724-4</td><td>2212-3431</td><td>Supplement 1</td><td>List(Political Economy, Social Choice, Historical Perspective, Welfare Economic, 50th Anniversary)</td><td>en</td><td>6</td><td></td><td></td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Foreword.</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CIST.2012.6388046, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6388046, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22998934?report=xml&format=text, http://dx.doi.org/10.2165/1159571-S0-000000000-00000, http://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/1159571-S0-000000000-00000, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27008821?report=xml&format=text, http://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e100-a_1_1, http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WINCOM.2016.7777230, https://doi.org/10.23919/ConTEL.2017.8000005, https://doi.org/10.1587/transfun.E101.A.1323, http://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e101-a_9_1323, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11786-018-0371-3, http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-002-1007-2, https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00125-002-1007-2, http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1024856009040010, https://link.springer.com/10.1134/S1024856009040010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0967-x, https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13280-017-0967-x, http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00355-005-0001-2, https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00355-005-0001-2, http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-005-4244-9, https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10584-005-4244-9, http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00148585, https://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF00148585)</td><td>List(53a7314420f7420be8d31c79, null, null, null, null, null, null, IEICE Transactions, null, null, null, null, 11)</td><td>1</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>53e99784b7602d9701f3f8c3</td><td>null</td><td>List(List(53f4d429dabfaeedd3781ccf, null, null, 5b86b6cfe1cd8e14a34d092b, J.R.

We use the fact that secondary structures are patterns of hydrogen bonds and that a single residue can participate in hydrogen bonds of at most one secondary structure. Consistency of fixed-sized pieces of secondary structures is the easiest to approximate and we formalize it as 1-2 matching problem. Consistency of entire secondary structures is a version of set packing. We also investigate how to form a simple problem if we add the requirement that the secondary structure and the loops that connect them fit together in a metric space.

In this paper, we have carried out series of intensive experiments at classrooms of Sumiyoshi Elementary School (7 or 8 years old; 83 subjects). The results are summarized as follows: 1) Devices the children use to learn do not affect the performance just after the study; 2) the PC use is effective when the target characters are complex and similar; and 3) The PC users keep remembering difficult shapes of characters after one month. These results have suggested that the use of PCs is superior to the ordinary oral lectures, however, it depends on the features of characters.",[["53f45a30dabfaefedbb5e0b1",null,null,"5b8698dde1cd8e14a382dcd6","Miki Namatame",null,null,null,null,"Tsukuba Univ. of Tech., Tsukuba, Japan",null,"5f71b3081c455f439fe3ffa0",null,null,null],["53f4350fdabfaeecd6953ace",null,null,"5b86b101e1cd8e14a323094b","Yasushi Harada",null,null,null,null,"Tama Art University, Hachioji, Japan",null,"5f71b44b1c455f439fe48fea",null,null,null],["54891cf6dabfae9b401347cc",null,null,"5b86b101e1cd8e14a323094b","Fusako Kusunoki",null,null,null,null,"Tama Art University, Hachioji, Japan",null,"5f71b44b1c455f439fe48fea",null,null,null],["53f46290dabfaefedbb79ed6",null,null,"5b86b6c2e1cd8e14a34cae99","Shigenori Inagaki",null,null,null,null,"Kobe University, Kobe, Japan",null,"5f71b2b11c455f439fe3d954",null,null,null],["5435332ddabfaebba58b12a4",null,null,"5b869260e1cd8e14a3587fe2","Takao Terano",null,null,null,null,"Tokyo Inst.

We propose four evaluation criteria, namely (1) recoverability, (2) the number of spurious patterns (3) the number of redundant patterns, and (4) the degree of extraneous items in the patterns, to quantitatively assess the quality of the mined results from a wide variety of synthetic datasets with varying randomness and noise levels. Recoverability, a new metric, measures how much of the underlying trend has been detected. Such an evaluation method provides a basis for comparing different models for sequential pattern mining. Furthermore, such evaluation is essential in understanding the performance of approximate solutions. In this paper, the method is employed to conduct a detailed comparison of the traditional frequent sequential pattern model with an alternative approximate pattern model based on sequence alignment.

In this paper we advance the state of the art in C-CBPS by showing how all predicate circuits in NC1 (logarithmic-depth, bounded fan-in) can be securely computed by a broker while guaranteeing perfect information-theoretic security. Previous work could handle only strictly shallower circuits (e.g. those with depth O(\\sqrt{\\lg n}) [SYY99, V76]. We present three protocols -- UGP-Match, FSGP-Match and OFSGP-Match -- all three are based on (2-decomposable randomized encodings of) group programs and handle circuits in NC1. UGP-Match is conceptually simple and has a clean proof of correctness but it is inefficient and impractical. FSGP-Match uses a \"fixed structure\" trick to achieve efficiency and scalability. And, finally, OFSGP-Match uses hand-optimized group programs to wring greater efficiencies. We complete our investigation with an experimental evaluation of a prototype implementation.

Switch requirements are particularly important in conventional VLSI where (a) a switchpoint consumes considerably more area than a wire crossing and (b) switchpoints must reside on the active surface, whereas wiring may take place on any of several wire layers. The most straight-forward, limited-bisection switching networks have switching requirements which grow as $O(N^{2p})$, similar to wiring requirements.

predictions may be simultaneously true. We use the fact that secondary structures are patterns of hydrogen bonds and that a single residue can participate in hydrogen bonds of at most one secondary structure. Consistency of fixed-sized pieces of secondary structures is the easiest to approximate and we formalize it as 1-2 matching problem. Consistency of entire secondary structures is a version of set packing. We also investigate how to form a simple problem if we add the requirement that the secondary structure and the loops that connect them fit together in a metric space. Every problem that we investigated is MAX-SNP hard and it has a constant factor approximation.

At the same time, our system provides typical information retrieval capabilities for querying medium-sized document collections of interrelated documents in the DBMS, with an acceptable performance.</td><td>List(List(53f429d6dabfaec09f0e3586, null, null, 5b869474e1cd8e14a365f07a, Carlos Garcia-Alvarado, null, null, null, null, University of Houston, Houston, TX, null, 5f71b2ab1c455f439fe3d644, null, null, null), List(53f4bc39dabfaeda9f77b5ad, null, null, 5b869474e1cd8e14a365f07a, Carlos Ordonez, null, null, null, null, University of Houston, Houston, TX, null, 5f71b2ab1c455f439fe3d644, null, null, null), List(53f4532edabfaedf435ff266, null, null, 5b869474e1cd8e14a365f07a, Zhibo Chen, null, null, null, null, University of Houston, Houston, TX, null, 5f71b2ab1c455f439fe3d644, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1145/1557670.1557688</td><td>List(SQL, XML, Information retrieval, Computer science, Sargable, Keyword search, Code generation, Database schema, Database)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>List(user-defined functions, typical database schema, document-to-metadata link, different level, interrelated document, typical information retrieval capability, sql code generation, browsing databases, large collection, acceptable performance, basic set, information retrieval, xml, code generation)</td><td>en</td><td>3</td><td>48</td><td>47</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9b042b7602d9703aa3593, 53e9a8ccb7602d970321e28e, 53e9a84eb7602d9703198848)</td><td>DBDOC: querying and browsing databases and interrelated documents</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1557670.1557688, http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1557670.1557688)</td><td>List(53a72bfd20f7420be8c363ba, null, null, International Conference on Management of Data, null, null, null, KEYS, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2009</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a5680</td><td>A number of compact representation forms that are investigated in the knowledge compilation community are utilized in interactive product configuration and other forms of decision support.

PYA seems to work well from users' behaviors and responses, however, the effectiveness has not been fully confirmed, so far. In this paper, we have carried out series of intensive experiments at classrooms of Sumiyoshi Elementary School (7 or 8 years old; 83 subjects). The results are summarized as follows: 1) Devices the children use to learn do not affect the performance just after the study; 2) the PC use is effective when the target characters are complex and similar; and 3) The PC users keep remembering difficult shapes of characters after one month. These results have suggested that the use of PCs is superior to the ordinary oral lectures, however, it depends on the features of characters.</td><td>List(List(53f45a30dabfaefedbb5e0b1, null, null, 5b8698dde1cd8e14a382dcd6, Miki Namatame, null, null, null, null, Tsukuba Univ. of Tech., Tsukuba, Japan, null, 5f71b3081c455f439fe3ffa0, null, null, null), List(53f4350fdabfaeecd6953ace, null, null, 5b86b101e1cd8e14a323094b, Yasushi Harada, null, null, null, null, Tama Art University, Hachioji, Japan, null, 5f71b44b1c455f439fe48fea, null, null, null), List(54891cf6dabfae9b401347cc, null, null, 5b86b101e1cd8e14a323094b, Fusako Kusunoki, null, null, null, null, Tama Art University, Hachioji, Japan, null, 5f71b44b1c455f439fe48fea, null, null, null), List(53f46290dabfaefedbb79ed6, null, null, 5b86b6c2e1cd8e14a34cae99, Shigenori Inagaki, null, null, null, null, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan, null, 5f71b2b11c455f439fe3d954, null, null, null), List(5435332ddabfaebba58b12a4, null, null, 5b869260e1cd8e14a3587fe2, Takao Terano, null, null, null, null, Tokyo Inst.

As a result, access control deployment strategies (in terms of where and when to do access control) and the impact of such strategies on end-to-end system performance are neglected by existing information brokerage systems. In addition, data source side access control deployment is taken-for-granted as the \"right\" thing to do.

Recoverability, a new metric, measures how much of the underlying trend has been detected. Such an evaluation method provides a basis for comparing different models for sequential pattern mining. Furthermore, such evaluation is essential in understanding the performance of approximate solutions. In this paper, the method is employed to conduct a detailed comparison of the traditional frequent sequential pattern model with an alternative approximate pattern model based on sequence alignment. We demonstrate that the alternative approach is able to better recover the underlying patterns with little confounding information under all circumstances we examined, including those where the frequent sequential pattern model fails.</td><td>List(List(53f42ba3dabfaedd74d1bd9e, null, kum@cs.unc.edu, 5b86b8eee1cd8e14a35c5613, Hye-Chung (Monica) Kum, null, null, null, null, Computer Science University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill North Carolina, null, 5f71b2891c455f439fe3c8db, null, null, null), List(53f479dddabfae8a6845c64e, null, null, 5b86b8eee1cd8e14a35c5613, Susan Paulsen, null, null, null, null, Computer Science University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill North Carolina, null, 5f71b2891c455f439fe3c8db, null, null, null), List(5602421a45cedb3395f4c6e6, null, null, 5b86b8eee1cd8e14a35c5613, Wei Wang, null, null, null, null, Computer Science University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill North Carolina, null, 5f71b2891c455f439fe3c8db, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1007/11498186_3</td><td>List(Data mining, Confounding, Evaluation methods, Computer science, Knowledge extraction, Spurious relationship, Sequential Pattern Mining, Randomness)</td><td></td><td>1860-949X</td><td></td><td>List(sequential pattern mining, sequence alignment)</td><td>en</td><td>10</td><td>70</td><td>43</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9a0b5b7602d970299c046, 53e99c44b7602d97024f6215, 53e9a07ab7602d9702966154, 53e99a2fb7602d97022886af, 53e9b862b7602d970442d562, 53e9a61fb7602d9702f4def1, 53e9a4b8b7602d9702dd9d62, 53e9abf7b7602d97035b98cd, 53e99845b7602d970207221c, 53e9ab48b7602d97034dcbe2, 53e9a8b0b7602d97031fba42, 53e9b8eeb7602d97044d1c33, 53e9b8a1b7602d970447e325, 53e9a749b7602d97030803e0, 53e99a67b7602d97022d4aa2, 53e9a2bab7602d9702bc3399)</td><td>Comparative Study of Sequential Pattern Mining Models</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11498186_3, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(null, 1860-949X, null, null, null, 1860-9503, null, STUDIES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, null, STUDIES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, null, J, null)</td><td>6</td><td>2005</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a583f</td><td>  Reference resolution is one of the important tasks in natural language processing.

Previous work could handle only strictly shallower circuits (e.g. those with depth O(\\sqrt{\\lg n}) [SYY99, V76]. We present three protocols -- UGP-Match, FSGP-Match and OFSGP-Match -- all three are based on (2-decomposable randomized encodings of) group programs and handle circuits in NC1. UGP-Match is conceptually simple and has a clean proof of correctness but it is inefficient and impractical. FSGP-Match uses a \"fixed structure\" trick to achieve efficiency and scalability. And, finally, OFSGP-Match uses hand-optimized group programs to wring greater efficiencies.
