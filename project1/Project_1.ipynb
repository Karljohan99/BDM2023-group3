is the first place in all the natural disasters in the world. It is especially serious in North China Plain. In this paper, different soil water content control levels at winter wheat growth stages are performed on Gucheng Ecological-Meteorological Integrated Observation Experiment Station of CAMS, China. Some canopy parameters, including growth conditions, dry weight, physiological parameters and hyperspectral reflectance, are measured from erecting stage to milk stage for winter wheat in 2009. The relationship between canopy parameters and soil relative moisture, canopy water content and water indices of winter wheat are established. The results show that some parameters, such as SPAD and dry weight of leaves, decrease with the increasing of soil relative moisture, while other parameters, including dry weight of caudexes, above ground dry weight, height, photosynthesis rate, intercellular CO 2 concentration, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, increase corresponding to the soil relative moisture.

in the world. It is especially serious in North China Plain. In this paper, different soil water content control levels at winter wheat growth stages are performed on Gucheng Ecological-Meteorological Integrated Observation Experiment Station of CAMS, China. Some canopy parameters, including growth conditions, dry weight, physiological parameters and hyperspectral reflectance, are measured from erecting stage to milk stage for winter wheat in 2009. The relationship between canopy parameters and soil relative moisture, canopy water content and water indices of winter wheat are established. The results show that some parameters, such as SPAD and dry weight of leaves, decrease with the increasing of soil relative moisture, while other parameters, including dry weight of caudexes, above ground dry weight, height, photosynthesis rate, intercellular CO 2 concentration, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, increase corresponding to the soil relative moisture. Obvious linear relationship between stomatal conductance and transpiration rate is established with 45 samples, which R2 reaches to 0.6152. Finally, the fitting equations between canopy water content and water indices are regressed with b5, b6 and b7 of MODIS bands. The equations are best with b7 and worst with b5. So the fitting equations with b7 can be used to inverse the canopy water content of winter wheat using MODIS or other remote sensing images with similar bands range to MODIS in Hebei Province. © 2011 IEEE.</td><td>List(List(53f45728dabfaec09f209538, null, null, null, Peijuan Wang, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(5601754345cedb3395e59457, null, null, null, Jiahua Zhang, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f38438dabfae4b34a08928, null, null, null, Donghui Xie, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(5601754345cedb3395e5945a, null, null, null, Yanyan Xu, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f43d25dabfaeecd6995149, null, null, null, Yun Xu, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049503</td><td>List(Agronomy, Moisture, Hydrology, Environmental science, Dry weight, Water content, Stomatal conductance, Transpiration, Irrigation, Soil water, Canopy)</td><td></td><td></td><td>null</td><td>List(canopy parameters, canopy spectrum, different soil water content control, winter wheat, irrigation, hydrology, radiometry, moisture, indexes, vegetation, indexation, dry weight, soil moisture, water content, indexing terms, spectrum, natural disaster)</td><td>en</td><td>0</td><td>1933</td><td>1930</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>The relationship between canopy parameters and spectrum of winter wheat under different irrigations in Hebei Province.</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049503)</td><td>List(53a7297d20f7420be8bd4ae7, null, null, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, null, null, null, IGARSS, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>null</td><td>2011</td></tr><tr><td>53e99784b7602d9701f3e151</td><td></td><td>List(List(53f46797dabfaeb22f542630, null, null, null, Jairo Rocha, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(54328883dabfaeb4c6a8a699, null, null, null, Theo Pavlidis, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1109/ICDAR.1993.395663</td><td>List(Intelligent character recognition, Pattern recognition, Computer science, Feature (computer vision), Document processing, Handwriting recognition, Optical character recognition, Feature extraction, Feature (machine learning), Artificial intelligence, Intelligent word recognition)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>List(handwriting recognition, prototypes, image segmentation, computer science, expert systems, knowledge base, pattern recognition, usability, optical character recognition, shape, feature extraction)</td><td>en</td><td>17</td><td>605</td><td>602</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e99cf5b7602d97025ace63, 557e8a7a6fee0fe990caa63d, 53e9a96cb7602d97032c459a, 53e9b929b7602d9704515791, 557e59ebf6678c77ea222447)</td><td>A solution to the problem of touching and broken characters.</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.1993.395663)</td><td>List(53a72a4920f7420be8bfa51b, null, null, International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, null, null, null, ICDAR-1, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>1993</td></tr><tr><td>53e99784b7602d9701f3e15d</td><td>As process variations become a significant problem in deep sub-micron technology, a shift from deterministic static timing analysis to statistical static timing analysis for high-performance circuit designs could reduce the excessive conservatism that is built into current timing design methods.

The system is suitable for use in conjunction with magnetic pen based devices for inputting data to a data processing system or a computer terminal. The features are extracted from dynamically changing locations of the writing device. The new method of feature extraction is simple, computationally light and fast enough for adaptive on-line use.

In this paper, we examine closely the problem of mining sequential patterns and propose a general evaluation method to assess the quality of the mined results. We propose four evaluation criteria, namely (1) recoverability, (2) the number of spurious patterns (3) the number of redundant patterns, and (4) the degree of extraneous items in the patterns, to quantitatively assess the quality of the mined results from a wide variety of synthetic datasets with varying randomness and noise levels. Recoverability, a new metric, measures how much of the underlying trend has been detected. Such an evaluation method provides a basis for comparing different models for sequential pattern mining.

In this paper, the method is employed to conduct a detailed comparison of the traditional frequent sequential pattern model with an alternative approximate pattern model based on sequence alignment.

The proposed methods based on semantic patterns show high accuracy for reference resolution of \"dousha\" (more than 90\\%).

Previous work could handle only strictly shallower circuits (e.g. those with depth O(\\sqrt{\\lg n}) [SYY99, V76].

UGP-Match is conceptually simple and has a clean proof of correctness but it is inefficient and impractical. FSGP-Match uses a \"fixed structure\" trick to achieve efficiency and scalability. And, finally, OFSGP-Match uses hand-optimized group programs to wring greater efficiencies. We complete our investigation with an experimental evaluation of a prototype implementation.

Applied to IGBTs, this process can minimize the magnitude of the current tail during turn-off when the temperature increases. The goal of the local lifetime control is to minimize the rise of the gain of the PNP bipolar transistor as well as the rise of the minority carrier lifetime, To evaluate the efficiency of that process, the following study presents a comparative analysis of turn-off switching performances for hard- and soft-switching at high temperature of 1200V new types of IGBT. In order to give an over-view of the local lifetime control process effect, both trench and new planar IGBTs performances have been investigated at high temperature and compared to conventional planar IGBT using global lifetime control. Current and voltage waveforms and turn-off switching losses are analyzed. Results show that the local lifetime control process is very efficient under hard-switching and zero-voltage switching, but this is not the case under zero-current switching, especially for the new planar IGBT.

This has often involved the need for the operator to know about the variables and structures of the expert system controlling the process as well as those of the system which it is controlling. In thk paper, we present a template-based Natural Language Generation (NLG) system which takes the output of a process control system and generates an appropriate message which can then be used for multi-mcda output. Tests are performed upon the syntactic structure of the process control system to choose an appropriate template. fn our system, the template can be viewed as a series of small functions, each of which generates one part of a sentence (noun phrase, verb phrase, etc.), and which are executed in a particular sequence in order to produce output. The ordering of the execution can be varied depending on the values of NLG system variables representing such thiigs as the tense of the utterance to be generated, and which have their values set during dte process of template choice. This NLG system is currently being implemented in a number of demonstration real-time process control system exemplars in industrial environments, and with generation in two languages (English and Dutch).",[["53f4302cdabfaec22ba3b726",null,null,null,"Paddy Matthews",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["53f43803dabfaee4dc7919fc",null,null,null,"Huk Mok",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]],"10.1145/143559.143601",["Question answering","Computer science","Expert system","Natural language programming","Natural language","Language identification","Natural language processing","Artificial intelligence","Process control"],"0-89791-502-X","","",[],"en","1","122","116",null,["53e9a129b7602d9702a18393","53e9a650b7602d9702f81355","53e999d8b7602d970221c4d8"],"Transforming expert system output into natural language in a process control environment",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/143559.143601","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/143559.143601"],[null,null,null,"ACM Symposium on Applied Computing",null,null,null,"SAC",null,null,null,null,"10"],"","1992",12],["53e99960b7602d97021a54f0","",[["53f4385cdabfaee43ec425d6",null,"mhmd.atallah@gmail.com",null,"M.A. Atallah",null,null,null,null,"Department of Statistics, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, P.O. 80203, Saudi Arabia",null,"5f71b3391c455f439fe415c6",["Department of Statistics, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, P.O. 80203, Saudi Arabia"],null,null]],"10.1016/j.camwa.2009.03.118",["Applied mathematics","Normal-gamma distribution","K-distribution","Mathematical analysis","Exponential family","Generalized integer gamma distribution","Generalized inverse Gaussian distribution","Gamma distribution","Inverse-gamma distribution","Generalized gamma distribution","Mathematics"],"","0898-1221","9",["gamma distribution","probability distribution"],"en","0","1886","1878",null,null,"Erratum to: “Probability distributions conditioned by the available information: Gamma Distribution and Moments” [Comput.

Interrupt, however, is expensive and may not be available in user-level communication protocols. This paper studies the performance of software DSMs using threads instead of interrupt for communication. We implement three thread communication methods in the JIAJIA software DSM. The first method separates a communication thread from the main thread, the second one divides the communication thread into a sending thread and a receiving thread, and the third method further splits a serving thread from the receiving thread. The effect of the thread communication methods is evaluated in a PC cluster and a cluster of PowerPC workstations with some well-accepted benchmarks. Evaluation results show that the performance of thread communication is slightly worse than that of interrupt communication when there is only one processor to run a process, but is better than that of interrupt communication when there are more than one processors in a node to run a process. The thread communication method with one sending thread and one receiving thread achieves the best performance inthethree thread communication methods. Besides, the effect of the thread communication is also related to the operating system. Analysis of the evaluation results reveals that the waiting time constitutes the major overhead of the execution, and the dominant factor that in uence waiting time is neither the interrupt overhead nor the thread switching overhead but the responsiveness of requests (i.e., whether requests can be processed and replied promptly).",[["53f435c2dabfaee0d9b60374",null,null,null,"Weiwu Hu Gang Shi",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["53f43f1adabfaedf435b948a",null,null,null,"Fuxin Zhang",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]],"",["Interrupt","Asynchronous communication","Win32 Thread Information Block","Computer science","Electronic mail","Thread (computing)","Thread safety","Spinlock","Operating system","Fiber (computer science)"],"0-7695-1116-3","","",[],"en","5","149","149",null,["53e9b36cb7602d9703e4982c","53e9b708b7602d970429fa17","53e9a8f9b7602d9703248078","53e9b44ab7602d9703f431c7","53e9bd50b7602d97049e5c58","53e9afe8b7602d9703a3c2d4","53e9b54ab7602d9704083364","53e99818b7602d9702034374","53e9af40b7602d9703980b1e","53e998c7b7602d97020ff4c0"],"Communication with Threads in Software DSMs",["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/CLUSTR.2001.959967"],["555037037cea80f95416df55",null,null,"Foundations of Computer Science",null,null,null,"CLUSTER",null,null,null,null,"0"],"","2001",6],["53e99967b7602d97021a5705","In today's scenario most of the programs are interdisciplinary in nature.

However, providing this service is a nontrivial task because of the lack of infrastructure and node limitations. Existing techniques distribute secret keys to the network users through a trusted third party or using computationally-complex public-key methods. An alternative approach is pre-distributing keying material to the nodes prior to the network deployment. Exploiting the mathematical properties of symmetric polynomials, we propose a multivariate key pre-distribution scheme (MKPS) in this paper. In this scheme, using uniquely assigned IDs, shares of d-variate polynomials are stored into the memory of every sensor. After the network deployment, every two neighbor nodes at the unit Hamming distance of each other establish exactly d-1 common keys without any interaction with a third party in the network. The final secret key used by these nodes is a symmetric combination of all the common keys. We will show that this feature significantly improves the security of the MKPS over previous schemes. The proposed method is in the category of threshold schemes, i.e., it remains perfectly secure up to the capture of a certain fraction of sensor nodes. We also propose a location-aware MKPS in which, by taking advantage of the location information, perfect connectivity is achieved. The new location-aware scheme is a cell-based method in which nodes are randomly deployed within hexagonal cells. Nodes are unaware of their exact locations. Nevertheless, they know the coordinates of their residing cells. One MKPS is used to secure communications within every cell and one to secure communications between cells.

However, the data set gathered from multiple session is vulnerable to the outliers from the irregular utterance variations and the presence of noise, which result in inaccurate speaker model. In this paper, we propose an incremental robust adaptation method to minimize the influence of outliers on Gaussian Mixture Model based speaker model.

First, some constraint combinations make the feasibility problem (Does there exist a single feasible solution?) NP-complete. Second, some constraint combinations when used with traditional agglomerative algorithms can cause the dendrogram to stop prematurely in a dead-end solution even though there exist other feasible solutions with a significantly smaller number of clusters. When constraints lead to efficiently solvable feasibility problems and standard agglomerative algorithms do not give rise to dead-end solutions, we empirically illustrate the benefits of using constraints to improve cluster purity and average distortion.

Existing algorithms may be arranged along an axis indi- cating how global the motion model used to constrain tracks is. Local methods, such as the KLT tracker, depend on lo- cal models of feature appearance, and are easily distracted by occlusions, repeated structure, and image noise. This leads to short tracks, many of which are incorrect. Alone, these require considerable postprocessing to obtain a use- ful result. In restricted scenes, for example a rigid scene through which a camera is moving, such postprocessing can make use of global motion models to allow \"guided match- ing\" which yields long high-quality feature tracks. How- ever, many scenes of interest contain multiple motions or significant non-rigid deformations which mean that guided matching cannot be applied. In this paper we propose a general amalgam of local and global models to improve tracking even in these diffi- cult cases. By viewing rank-constrained tracking as a prob- abilistic model of 2D tracks rather than 3D motion, we ob- tain a strong, robust motion prior, derived from the global motion in the scene.

In this paper we present more evidence to the value of such representations. Our results hinge on the notion of relevance, and model based representations are shown to be useful in capturing relevant information, and in allowing to ignore irrelevant information. In particular, we consider situations where context-specific information is used in the process of reasoning. We show that reasoning with model-based representations can be done efficiently in the presence of varying context information. We then consider the task of default reasoning. We show that default reasoning is a generalization of reasoning within context, in which the reasoner has many ``context\" rules, which may be conflicting. We develop model-based algorithms that handle efficiently fragments of Reiter''s default logic. Our intuition about relevance is best captured in the model for reasoning within context, where model-based representations enable us to filter out irrelevant information. Interestingly, default logic is somewhat in contrast with our intuition about relevance. Default rules do not tell us explicitly what the context information is. Instead, we have to figure out what are the possible ``extensions\" and then use those as possible contexts. As we show, model-based representations capture all possible extensions in an accessible form, thereby supporting efficient default reasoning whenever possible. Lastly, we argue that these results support an incremental view of reasoning in a natural way. We discuss the Learning to Reason framework, which emphasizes this view, and the notion of relevance as manifested in it.

It is necessary to locate the technical patterns in the stock price movement charts to analyze the market behavior. Indeed, there are two main problems: how to define those preferred patterns (technical patterns) for query and how to match the defined pattern templates in different resolutions. As we can see, defining the similarity between time series (or time series subsequences) is of fundamental importance. By identifying the perceptually important points (PIPs) directly from the time domain, time series and templates of different lengths can be compared. Three ways of distance measure, including Euclidean distance (PIP-ED), perpendicular distance (PIP-PD) and vertical distance (PIP-VD), for PIP identification are compared in this paper. After the PIP identification process, both template- and rule-based pattern-matching approaches are introduced. The proposed methods are distinctive in their intuitiveness, making them particularly user friendly to ordinary data analysts like stock market investors. As demonstrated by the experiments, the template- and the rule-based time series matching and subsequence searching approaches provide different directions to achieve the goal of pattern identification.",[["53f43525dabfaeb22f466c97",null,"cstcfu@comp.polyu.edu.hk","5b86c9f1e1cd8e14a3d6d552","Tak-chung Fu",null,null,null,null,"Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hunghom, Kowloon, Hong Kong",null,"5f71b2961c455f439fe3ce47",["Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hunghom, Kowloon, Hong Kong","Corresponding author.

The values of attributes defined for each pair [object, attribute], called descriptors, are assumed to be unique and precise. In practice, however, these attribute values may be neither unique nor precise, i.e. they can be uncertain. We are distinguishing four types of uncertainty affecting values of attributes: uncertain discretization of quantitative attributes, imprecision of values of numerical attributes, unknown (missing) values of attributes, multiple values possible for one pair [object, attribute]. We propose a special way of modelling the first three types of uncertainty using fuzzy sets, which boils them down to the fourth type, called shortly, multiple descriptors. Thus, the generalization of the rough set approach consists in handling the case of multiple descriptors for both condition and decision attributes. The generalization preserves all characteristic features of the rough set approach while enabling reasoning about uncertain data.

However, large-scale MS faces the potential problem of mass degeneracy---indistinguishable masses for multiple biopolymer fragments (e.g., from a limited proteolytic digest). This paper studies the tasks of planning and interpreting MS experiments that use selective isotopic labeling, thereby substantially reducing potential mass degeneracy. Our algorithms support an experimental--computational protocol called structure-activity relation by mass spectrometry (SAR by MS) for elucidating the function of protein-DNA and protein-protein complexes. SAR by MS enzymatically cleaves a crosslinked complex and analyzes the resulting mass spectrum for mass peaks of hypothesized fragments. Depending on binding mode, some cleavage sites will be shielded; the absence of anticipated peaks implicates corresponding fragments as either part of the interaction region or inaccessible due to conformational change upon binding. Thus, different mass spectra provide evidence for different structure--activity relations.

However, according to existing strongest receiving signal association method, pico cells with the extremely low transmitting power are significantly limited in the presence of macro coverage. Thus, the new introduced pico frequency resource will not be fully exploited in this unbalanced user distributions among macro and pico cells. In this paper, by jointly considering the long term channel condition and load balance in this macro-pico coexisted heterogeneous network, we formulate the cell selection problem into a network-wide proportional fairness optimization. Both optimal solution (by dynamic programming) and cost efficient algorithm (greedy heuristics) are proposed. In 3GPP LTE-A heterogeneous network scenario, the system-level performance evaluation shows that, compared with the conventional strongest signal cell selection scheme, the proposed optimized fairness cell selection methods could achieve significant performance gains especially for the cell edge users. © 2011 IEEE.",[["53f4a8b9dabfaeb22f57485c",null,null,null,"Jun Wang",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["5405e6e3dabfae91d301a742",null,null,null,"Jianguo Liu",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["53f436b6dabfaedd74da36bd",null,null,null,"Dongyao Wang",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["53f444b5dabfaee4dc7ca574",null,null,null,"Jiyong Pang",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["53f43316dabfaedd74d7e567",null,null,null,"Gang Shen",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]],"10.1109/VETECF.2011.6092994",["Load balancing (computing)","Computer network","Bandwidth (signal processing)","Cellular network","Heterogeneous network","Engineering","Macro","Channel capacity","LTE Advanced","Telecommunications link"],"","","null",["cost effectiveness","cellular network","signal to noise ratio","heuristic algorithm","downlink","heterogeneous network","greedy heuristic","proportional fair","scheduling","cost efficiency","channel capacity","interference","bandwidth","load balance"],"en","60","5","1",null,["53e9b304b7602d9703dcb639","53e9a584b7602d9702eac676","53e9b31bb7602d9703de82c0","558a30fde4b031bae1f63058","53e9a26bb7602d9702b741bc","558aaf9fe4b0b32fcb384499","53e9b5afb7602d97040f3019","53e9b708b7602d970429b6a1"],"Optimized Fairness Cell Selection for 3GPP LTE-A Macro-Pico HetNets.",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VETECF.2011.6092994"],["555037327cea80f954179453",null,null,"Vehicular Technology Conference",null,null,null,"VTC Fall",null,null,null,null,"0"],"null","2011",9],["53e99967b7602d97021a57cf","",[["53f42b55dabfaeb2acfc9713",null,null,null,"Hideki Sawaguchi",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["53f444cbdabfaeb22f4b91a2",null,null,null,"Morishi Izumita",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["53f439f2dabfaeb22f491d17",null,null,null,"Seiichi Mita",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]],"10.1109/GLOCOM.2003.1258964",["Sequential decoding","Soft output Viterbi algorithm","Computer science","Communication channel","Algorithm","Speech recognition","Decoding methods","Iterative Viterbi decoding","Detector","Viterbi algorithm","Computation"],"","","",["Viterbi detection","data recording","decoding","digital magnetic recording","magnetic recording noise","maximum likelihood detection","ML detector","PRML channels","Viterbi detection","computational complexity","data-dependent media noise","high-density recording","high-speed circuit implementation","lookup-table architecture","magnetic recording systems","media-noise soft-output decoding","post-processing decoding","recording channels","signal-dependent correlation-sensitive metric estimation","soft-output data-detection","soft-output post-processing detection","sub-optimal maximum-likelihood sequence detection"],"en","6","3920","3913",null,["53e9b3c1b7602d9703eab60d","53e99cbcb7602d9702570f22","53e99ddbb7602d970269cf57","558a8cdce4b0b32fcb377b92","53e9a6e6b7602d970301c717","53e99f2db7602d97027f9466"],"Soft-output post-processing detection for PRML channels in the presence of data-dependent media noise.",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2003.1258964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1258964"],["555037577cea80f954182982",null,null,"Global Communications Conference",null,null,null,"GLOBECOM",null,null,null,null,"0"],"7","2003",13],["53e99967b7602d97021a57d0","In traditional accounting,cost is an accumulating process little by little but revenue is realized and recognized on a timeline.Though revenue matches cost,there are different notion about revenue and cost in accounting,which reflects that it is a flaw of traditional accounting theory.Based on the idea of accumulating and assigning cost with the production process and combining the latent customers’ state transformation under Electronic Commerce(EC) circumstances,the author present that revenue realization be a process and not be a point-in-time.

This research is motivated in part by the potential application of speaker recognition technologies on handheld devices or the Internet. While the technologies promise an additional biometric layer of security to protect the user, the practical implementation of such systems faces many challenges. One of these is environmental noise. Due to the mobile nature of such systems, the noise sources can be highly time-varying and potentially unknown. This raises the requirement for noise robustness in the absence of information about the noise. This paper describes a method that combines multicondition model training and missing-feature theory to model noise with unknown temporal-spectral characteristics. Multicondition training is conducted using simulated noisy data with limited noise variation, providing a ldquocoarserdquo compensation for the noise, and missing-feature theory is applied to refine the compensation by ignoring noise variation outside the given training conditions, thereby reducing the training and testing mismatch. This paper is focused on several issues relating to the implementation of the new model for real-world applications. These include the generation of multicondition training data to model noisy speech, the combination of different training data to optimize the recognition performance, and the reduction of the model's complexity. The new algorithm was tested using two databases with simulated and realistic noisy speech data. The first database is a redevelopment of the TIMIT database by rerecording the data in the presence of various noise types, used to test the model for speaker identification with a focus on the varieties of noise. The second database is a handheld-device database collected in realistic noisy condi- tions, used to further validate the model for real-world speaker verification. The new model is compared to baseline systems and is found to achieve lower error rates.",[["54484ac2dabfae87b7e009e7",null,null,"5b86cf37e1cd8e14a3fd5138","Ji Ming",null,null,null,null,"Queen's Univ.

By carrying out experimentation with the proposed conceptual model, all three levels were tested in different industrial sectors during its development. Three real-world case studies are presented to test and to show the flexibility and applicability of the framework.

Differing from other existing naming game models, in NGG everyone in the population (network) can be both speaker and hearer simultaneously, which resembles in a closer manner to real-life scenarios. Moreover, NGG allows the transmission (communication) of multiple words (opinions) for multiple intra-group consensuses. The communications among indirectly-connected nodes are also enabled in NGG. We simulated and analyzed the consensus process in some typical network topologies, including random-graph networks, small-world networks and scale-free networks, to better understand how global convergence (consensus) could be reached on one common word. The results are interpreted on group negotiation of a peer-to-peer network, which shows that global consensus in the population can be reached more rapidly when more opinions are permitted within each group or when the negotiating groups in the population are larger in size.

Approximation procedures, such as penalized quasi-likelihood, are computationally efficient, but the resulting estimators can be seriously biased for binary responses. Gauss-Hermite quadrature and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration based methods can yield more accurate estimation, but they are computationally much more intensive. Estimation methods that can achieve both computational efficiency and estimation accuracy are still under development. This paper proposes an efficient direct sampling based Monte Carlo EM algorithm (DSMCEM) for latent variable models with binary responses. Mixed effects and item factor analysis models with binary responses are used to illustrate this algorithm. Results from two simulation studies and a real data example suggest that, as compared with MCMC based EM, DSMCEM can significantly improve computational efficiency as well as produce equally accurate parameter estimates.

This question has been tackled for various complex systems such as cellular automata, Boolean networks, neural networks but little is known for multi-agent systems, especially for the models with a complex behaviour which emerges from simple local rules. This paper focuses on a multi-turmite model, namely the multiple Langton's ants model. All the agents are updated simultaneously and the variation of the updating scheme consists only in choosing different strategies for solving the conflicts produced when two or more agents want to go on the same location. We show that for the same formulation of the agents' behaviour, and the same initial conditions, the use of different updating schemes may lead to qualitatively different evolutions of the system. As a positive spin-off of this study, we exhibit new phenomena of the multi-turmite model such as deadlocks or gliders.",[["53f4568edabfaee43ecbd693",null,null,"5b86c4f3e1cd8e14a3b2b326","Nazim Fatès",null,null,null,null,"INRIA Nancy Grand-Est - LORIA, Villers-lès-Nancy, France",null,"5f71b29a1c455f439fe3d023",null,null,null],["53f7c32bdabfae938c6d8cd7",null,null,"5b868e9de1cd8e14a3407efd","Vincent Chevrier",null,null,null,null,"Nancy University UHP - LORIA, Vandoeuvre-lès-Nancy, France",null,null,null,null,null]],"",["Complex system","Cellular automaton","Know-how","Computer science","Deadlock","Multi-agent system","Turmite","Artificial intelligence","Artificial neural network"],"","","",["complex behaviour","different strategy","different evolution","ants model","cellular automaton","multi-turmite model","multi-agent system","open question","boolean network","various complex system","neural network","multi agent system","complex system","cellular automata","initial condition","complex systems"],"en","8","540","533","https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/1373/200/144/53e99967b7602d97021a5bd2_0.pdf",["53e9b0ccb7602d9703b45111","53e9a3fbb7602d9702d13365","53e9a6a0b7602d9702fd4fe8","53e9aa86b7602d97033fc96e","53e9a6f5b7602d970302ccad","53e99e28b7602d97026eca95","53e9a3fbb7602d9702d14a59","53e9bbeab7602d97048414c8","53e9a335b7602d9702c40898","53e9a1bdb7602d9702ab66b9","53e9bbfbb7602d9704857d58"],"How important are updating schemes in multi-agent systems?

We aim to find video according to higher level similarities, which is beyond the scope of traditional near duplicate search. Following the popular hashing technique we employ compact binary codes to facilitate nearest neighbor search. Unlike the previous methods which capitalize on only one type of hash code for retrieval, this paper combines heterogeneous hash codes to effectively describe the diverse and multi-scale visual contents in videos. Our method integrates feature pooling and hashing in a single framework. In the pooling stage, we cast video frames into a set of pre-specified components, which capture a variety of semantics of video contents. In the hashing stage, we represent each video component as a compact hash code, and combine multiple hash codes into hash tables for effective search. To speed up the retrieval while retaining most informative codes, we propose a graph-based influence maximization method to bridge the pooling and hashing stages. We show that the influence maximization problem is submodular, which allows a greedy optimization method to achieve a nearly optimal solution. Our method works very efficiently, retrieving thousands of video clips from TRECVID dataset in about 0.001 second. For a larger scale synthetic dataset with 1M samples, it uses less than 1 second in response to 100 queries. Our method is extensively evaluated in both unsupervised and supervised scenarios, and the results on TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection and Columbia Consumer Video datasets demonstrate the success of our proposed technique.",[["53f45b6edabfaedd74e40a82",null,null,"5b869b4fe1cd8e14a393fd2e","Liangliang Cao",null,null,null,null,"IBM Watson Research Center, Hawthorne, NY, USA",null,"5f71b5c41c455f439fe532ea",null,null,null],["54054d47dabfae450f3a27d1",null,null,"5b86a6d6e1cd8e14a3dfe6f4","Zhenguo Li",null,null,null,null,"Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA",null,"5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5ab",null,null,null],["53f46df6dabfaee2a1dcce6f",null,null,"5b86a6d6e1cd8e14a3dfe6f4","Yadong Mu",null,null,null,null,"Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA",null,"5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5ab",null,null,null],["53f49da0dabfaebfa777b6e1",null,null,"5b86a6d6e1cd8e14a3dfe6f4","Shih-Fu Chang",null,null,null,null,"Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA",null,"5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5ab",null,null,null]],"10.1145/2393347.2393393",["Locality-sensitive hashing","Data mining","Double hashing","Computer science","Universal hashing","Feature hashing","Artificial intelligence","Hash function","Machine learning","Dynamic perfect hashing","Open addressing","Hash table"],"","","",["video clip","efficient large-scale video retrieval","hash code","graph-based influence maximization method","submodular video","compact hash code","video content","hash table","unified framework","greedy optimization method","video frame","video component","indexing","submodular"],"en","52","308","299","//static.aminer.org/pdf/20170130/pdfs/mm/d5lckv3d0pre6wfxjrenlkygum9op1ig.pdf",["53e99bf0b7602d970249e152","53e9a33db7602d9702c4932e","53e9a7ebb7602d970312da69","558bb5bfe4b00c3c48de0a4f","53e9a12ab7602d9702a1ca94","53e997fcb7602d97020083d9","53e9aeddb7602d9703905979","558b016c84ae84d265c0ee86","53e99d81b7602d970263eaa8","53e9a0f3b7602d97029dc1f7","558bc45ae4b00c3c48de5a0f","53e9bc6eb7602d97048ea570","53e9b88bb7602d970445be1a","53e99bb9b7602d9702463373","53e99e94b7602d970275cb91","558a3998e4b037c08755e0fa","53e9a5f0b7602d9702f1bae9","53e9a0fbb7602d97029e6239","53e9a99cb7602d97032f707c","53e9a358b7602d9702c670f8","53e9a66eb7602d9702fa13c5","53e99b1bb7602d97023adfe7","53e9aadfb7602d97034623f3","53e9bccbb7602d970494e4f0","53e9b31bb7602d9703de75ab","53e9b281b7602d9703d28e88","53e9b055b7602d9703ab90bf","53e9a719b7602d970305252b","53e99c43b7602d97024f09da","53e9ab89b7602d970353389a","53e99d2fb7602d97025e3847","53e9b1eab7602d9703c7f96b"],"Submodular video hashing: a unified framework towards video pooling and indexing",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2393347.2393393","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2393347.2393393","https://static.aminer.org/pdf/20170130/pdfs/index.txt"],["53a72e0620f7420be8c7c642",null,null,"ACM Multimedia",null,null,null,"ACM Multimedia 2001",null,null,null,null,"0"],"","2012",11],["53e99967b7602d97021a5a2b","The paper presents a novel derivation of the average au- tocorrelation and the average power spectrum for Markov renewal processes.

More so than for bulk file transfer or media delivery, lossless sequential streaming poses an even greater challenge for the common problem cases of retransmission protocols, such as lossy links or long network paths, manifesting as significant latency in the interactive user experience. We propose a hybrid FEC-ARQ protocol built on a packet streaming code that reduces to a simple strategy over sending or resending original data packets or check packets combining undecoded packets, based on actual network conditions. Experimental results show that our proposed protocol can significantly improve the total delay over retransmission and other schemes that use FEC, under a range of bandwidth and loss scenarios.",[["53f431addabfaec22ba4ee3c",null,null,"5b868b2de1cd8e14a32a9046","Ying-zong Huang",null,null,null,null,"Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology",null,"5f71b2831c455f439fe3c633",null,null,null],["53f431f1dabfaee1c0a6ea54",null,null,"5b8692d7e1cd8e14a35b8b51","Sanjeev Mehrotra",null,null,null,null,"Communication and Collaboration Systems, Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA",null,"5f71b2831c455f439fe3c634",null,null,null],["542a5149dabfae646d54e36d",null,null,"5b8692d7e1cd8e14a35b8b51","Jin Li",null,null,null,null,"Communication and Collaboration Systems, Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA",null,"5f71b2831c455f439fe3c634",null,null,null]],"10.1109/ICME.2009.5202596",["Forward error correction","Lossy compression","Computer science","Retransmission","Network packet","Computer network","Real-time computing","Automatic repeat request","File transfer","Lossless compression","The Internet"],"978-1-4244-1291-1","1945-7871 E-ISBN : 978-1-4244-1291-1","",["sequential stream","original data packet","long network path","data packets","protocols","retransmission protocols","actual network condition","lossless data","lossless sequential streaming","lossless data streaming","retransmission protocol","check packets","interactive internet","sequential data ordering","sequential data","low-delay data streaming","hybrid fec-arq protocol","interactive internet applications","low-delay lossless","sequential data streaming","media delivery","electronic data interchange","packet streaming code","bulk file transfer","media streaming","internet","forward error correction","lossless data exchange","reliability","automatic repeat request","lossy links","network paths","proposed protocol","undecoded packets","indexes","data exchange","decoding","encoding"],"en","22","725","718",null,["53e9aec4b7602d97038eccbc","5c78e8f04895d9cbc6ff4eff","53e9b7cdb7602d97043798c8","53e99e54b7602d97027164f7","53e9b469b7602d9703f69b29","53e9994cb7602d970218d373","53e9ab90b7602d9703539aea"],"A hybrid FEC-ARQ protocol for low-delay lossless sequential data streaming",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2009.5202596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5202596"],["53a72eaa20f7420be8c96328",null,null,"International Conference on Multimedia and Expo",null,null,null,"ICME",null,null,null,null,"0"],"","2009",10],["53e99967b7602d97021a5e6d","Current web search mostly relies on the keywords in the web pages.

On the contrary, search semantic is to find the information about the person in the real world. It is hard to achieve this goal in current content based web search engines because text is not useful during inference. The semantic web brings semantic to current web with formalized knowledge and data that computers can process. Therefore search can be benefit from the inference which is supported by ontology.

However, existing estimation algo- rithms are either inaccurate or too complex. In this paper we propose an enhanced version of the IEEE 802.11 DCF that employs an estimator of the number of competing terminals based on a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) or a approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach. The algorithm uses a Bayesian framework, optimizing the backoff parameters of the DCF based on the predictive distribution of the num- ber of competing terminals. We show that our algorithm is simple yet highly accurate even at small time scales. We implement our proposed new DCF in the ns-2 simulator and show that it outperforms existing methods. We also show that its accuracy can be used to improve the results of the protocol even when the nodes are not in saturation mode.",[["53f4507edabfaec09f1eff1a",null,null,"5b86af92e1cd8e14a318b0f1","Alberto Lopez",null,null,null,null,"Department of Electrical Engineering|Columbia University|Epidaure Research Group",null,"5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5ab",null,null,null],["54093dbadabfae8faa678f8f",null,null,"5b86af92e1cd8e14a318b0f1","Tom Vercauteren",null,null,null,null,"Department of Electrical Engineering|Columbia University|Epidaure Research Group",null,"5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5ab",null,null,null],["53f58f25dabfaedb01f8047b",null,null,"5b86af92e1cd8e14a318b0f1","Xiaodong Wang",null,null,null,null,"Department of Electrical Engineering|Columbia University|Epidaure Research Group",null,"5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5ab",null,null,null]],"10.1109/ICASSP.2005.1416458",["Mathematical optimization","Monte Carlo method","IEEE 802.11","Computer science","Particle filter","Distributed coordination function","Bayesian framework","Maximum a posteriori estimation","Estimator","Bayesian probability"],"","","",["Bayes methods","IEEE standards","Monte Carlo methods","maximum likelihood estimation","optimisation","protocols","state estimation","wireless LAN","Bayesian estimators","DCF","IEEE 802.11 protocol","MAP estimation","approximate maximum a posteriori estimation","backoff parameters","competing terminals","distributed coordination function","network state","ns-2 simulator","optimization mechanisms","predictive distribution","saturation mode","sequential Monte Carlo estimation"],"en","5","936","933","https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/2046/200/144/53e99967b7602d97021a5e73_0.pdf",["558a6cab84ae84d265bd8722","53e9b3c7b7602d9703eb2a42","53e9ab64b7602d97034fdaf4","53e9b2f0b7602d9703dac4a4"],"OPTIMIZING IEEE 802.11 DCF USING BAYESIAN ESTIMATORS OF THE NETWORK STATE",["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2005.1416458","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1416458"],["53a724e220f7420be8b3d1aa",null,null,null,null,null,null,"ICASSP",null,null,null,null,"0"],"5","2005",11],["53e99967b7602d97021a5a5a","Cooperative networks allow the nodes relaying each other's messages to enhance the transmission reliability over wireless fading channels by achieving cooperative diversity. Among the various relaying protocols, the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy is well studied for its simplicity. However, to collect the cooperative diversity, there are two main issues that the AF protocol is facing. One is that the channel state information (CSI) of the source-to-relay link (i.e., two-hop CSI) is needed at the destination. The other concern is that the power scaling factor (PSF) and output signals at the relay are unbounded. These two issues make AF less practical in resource constrained networks, e.g., blind and peak power constrained relays. In this paper, we reveal the necessary and sufficient conditions on designing the PSF for the maximum ratio combining (MRC) receiver at the destination with two-hop (TH) CSI to achieve full cooperative diversity. Furthermore, we also provide the necessary conditions on the PSF design so that MRC with only one-hop (OH) CSI still collects full cooperative diversity. These designs make AF strategies more general and practical.

Unlike previous financial crisis, one major driver of this crisis is the contagious failures of banks through a network of interbank payments and correlated bank portfolios of financial products. The risk that the failure of a single bank can cause a cascading failure of other connected banks and may potentially bring down the entire banking system (network), is defined as systemic risk. Existing bank risk management research focused on the causes and impacts of systemic risk but largely ignored the monitoring and preventive mechanism. In this study, we developed a network-based algorithm to rank systemic risk of banks and financial products in the bank network. In addition, we extended the network model of banking system developed in previous systemic risk research and adopted this model in the evaluation experiment of our proposed algorithm.

Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging as a global network for connecting any objects (physical or virtual) across the globe, ranging applications from home appliances to consumer electronics. In IoT, physical objects such as home appliances, vehicles, supply-chain items, containers, etc. should have unique identities for interacting among themselves. As a result, unique identification of trillion of objects is a foremost requirement in IoT. RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) technology plays an important role in IoT for solving identification issues of objects around us in a cost effective manner. The usage of low cost RFID tags draws greater attention from researchers in recent past, as the cost of supply-chain items should not exceed much because of embedded tag cost. The communication between tag and reader takes place over insecure channel. Therefore, security concern has become an important issue in RFID systems. In recent years, several light-weight protocols and improvements have been proposed for RFID security. Some of them have succeeded with their security claim, but many protocols suffer from security weaknesses or design flaws.

Mechanisms were designed and tested to move the spines into and out of contact with the screen. After the spine engages the substrate, springs along the leg are compressed. The opposing lateral spring forces constitute a distributed inward grip that is similar to forces measured on climbing insects and geckos.

Basic LOTOS is the version of LOTOS without value-passing. A widely used approach to the verification of temporal properties is model checking. Often, in this approach the formal specification is translated into a labeled transition system on which formulae expressing properties are checked. A problem with this verification technique is state explosion: concurrent systems are often represented by automata with a prohibitive number of states. In this paper we show how, given a set rho of actions, it is possible to automatically obtain for a Basic LOTOS program a reduced transition system to which only the arcs labeled by actions in rho belong. The set rho of actions plays a fundamental role in conjunction with a temporal logic defined by the authors in a previous paper: selective mu-calculus. The reduced system with respect to rho preserves the truth value of all selective mu-calculus formulae with actions from the set rho. We act at both syntactic and semantic levels. From a syntactic point of view, we define a set of transformation rules obtaining a smaller program. On the semantic side, we define a non-standard semantics which dynamically reduces the transition system during generation, We present a tool implementing both the syntactic and the semantic reduction.

Autism-relevant phenotypes in the inbred mouse strain BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) offer translational tools to discover biological mechanisms underlying unusual mouse behaviors analogous to symptoms of autism. Two of the most consistent findings with BTBR are lack of sociability as measured by the three-chamber social approach task and increased amount of time engaged in self-grooming in an empty cage. Here we evaluated BTBR as compared to two typical inbred strains with high sociability and low self-grooming, C57BL/6J (B6) and FVB/AntJ (FVB), on both the automated three-chambered social approach task and repetitive self-grooming assays. Brains from the behaviorally tested mice were analyzed using magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging to investigate potential neuroanatomical abnormalities throughout the brain; specifically, to discover neuroanatomical mechanisms which could explain the autism-relevant behavioral abnormalities. Significant differences in volume and white matter microstructure were detected in multiple anatomical regions throughout the brain of BTBR compared to B6 and FVB. Further, significant correlations were found between behavioral measures and areas of the brain known to be associated with those behaviors. For example, striatal volume was strongly correlated to time spent in self-grooming across strains. Our findings suggest that neuropathology exists in BTBR beyond the previously reported white matter abnormalities in the corpus callosum and hippocampal commissure and that these brain differences may be related to the behavioral abnormalities seen in BTBR.",[["53f31f19dabfae9a8444b431",null,"jacob@phenogenomics.ca",null,"Jacob Ellegood",null,null,null,null,"Mouse Imaging Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada",null,null,["Mouse Imaging Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada","Corresponding author at: Mouse Imaging Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, 25 Orde Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5T 3H7.

For those modern real-time systems, the limitations of original static Response Time Analysis (RTA) become more and more conspicuous. Most static analysis methods not only require much detailed system information, but also only target to some specific system model with non-realistic assumptions. As a result, those methods may produce overly pessimistic results, making them unsuitable to be applied on a complex industrial system. The best system model may be the system itself. Therefore, statistical RTA, which can produce probabilistic analysis results based on samples provided by real systems or simulators, may become more expedient. Statistical RTA usually requires more relaxed assumptions and less system information than static RTA. In this paper, we present an Extreme Value Theory (EVT) based method to compute Worst-Case Response Time (WCRT) targeting complex real-time systems. In the evaluation phase, we have applied this method to the calculation of worst-case transmission delays of messages over Controller Area Network (CAN), and some comparisons with static RTA are also provided.

This new Web, Web 2.0, is a mesh of enhanced semantics, push application widgets, and embedded scripting languages and was developed to pursue the promise of enhanced interactivity. The possible benefits of Web 2.0 are great, but it seems that without timely and prompt action disabled users will be barred from these benefits. Indeed, using sites such as: Flicker, YouTube, MySpace, Google Maps, and Google Portal will rapidly become 'offlimits' to disabled users. Semantic Web technologies have already shown themselves to be useful in addressing some issues of Web Accessibility. However, this new technology has not yet started to make its way into mainstream applications. Without change, will the benefits of the Semantic Web be lost? Will the promising enhanced interactivity of Web 2.0 technologies become increasingly inaccessible to disabled users? We pose the question: \"Web 2.0 and the Semantic Web: Hindrance or Opportunity?\" The conference was held on Monday the 7th and Tuesday the 8th of May 2007 at the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel in Banff National Park. We welcomed 65 attendees pursuing research on Web accessibility. We accepted 40.3% of all submissions, each paper was peer reviewed by the three of our programme committee. In brief, the conference proceedings brought together a cross section of Web design, engineering and Web accessibility research. The papers included report on developments on the Web 2.0 and Semantic Web, discussed the issues regarding the evolvement of the Web, and suggested cross-pollinated solutions. Comments from our attendees suggested that they enjoyed the conference and would be participating again next year. Our social programme also attracted almost all of our delegates, which was a great fun.

In this paper, we extend this architectural model to encompass UI-enabled devices, thereby enabling it to cover human-to-application conversations as well. This permits either participant to be human-driven, automated, or anywhere in between, without affecting the nature of the interaction or of the other participant. The UI-enabled conversational model also reduces the difficulty of developing conversational applications, providing significant benefits both for UI and for application developers. We describe the architecture of a UI-enabled conversational system that supports a variety of user devices, and includes a means by which UI markup may be automatically generated from the conversational protocols used. We go through a sample application currently implemented using a commercially available application server, and further describe a graphical tool for editing and testing conversational protocols, that significantly eases the protocol development process.",[["54088149dabfae450f42246a",null,null,null,"James E.

Although it is a dynamic and naturally engaging subject there are significant barriers which make it difficult for a student to engage realistically with network protocols. These can be categorised as barriers of time, space and access. From the perspective of time, many of the interactions occur at timescales that are outside of the range of human perception; from the perspective of space, a student will be situated in one location which will often define their view of the network; from the perspective of access, interaction with network protocols is mediated through libraries provided by operating systems which in turn require the use of programming languages to manipulate.

Using the dynamic model, a global and comprehensive dynamic performance index (GCDPI) is proposed to evaluate the manipulator capabilities in terms of dynamic manipulability and dexterity in the prescribed task space. The dynamic optimization problem, which aims at providing the largest, the most isotropic and the most uniform dynamic manipulability of the 2-DoF TPM in the task space, is formulated as the minimization of GCDPI subjected to a set of appropriate constraints. Optimization results showed that the dynamic manipulability of the 2-DoF TPM with optimized kinematic and inertial parameters improves greatly in the prescribed task space.

Background: Iconic signals, such as a cough to signal dangerous levels of carbon monoxide, convey information about the nature of an incident and alert the operator that there is a problem, whereas signals that are arbitrarily associated with a critical incident provide relatively less information. Warning recognition speed and accuracy are likely to be influenced by modality of presentation (visual, auditory, auditory + visual) and task demand (low, high). Methods: The 172 participants completed a computer-based training session and test task that involved responding to abstract or iconic auditory (1s), visual, or auditory + visual warnings associated with seven critical incidents while performing low- and high-demand concurrent tasks. Results: Significantly fewer training trials were required to learn iconic warnings than abstract warnings. An advantage for iconic warnings persisted into the test phase, evident most consistently as greater warning recognition accuracy. The effect was observed in both high- and low-demand conditions. Auditory abstract warnings, in particular, elicited slow reaction times and poor accuracy. Conclusion: Associations between a small number of meaningful environmental sounds and critical incidents can be learned with ease relative to more abstract associations, although training is required and response times are relatively slow. Application: Sets of distinctive auditory iconic warnings can be designed to alert and inform pilots about non-time-pressured events. Potential applications of language-neutral icons as informative warnings include civil, commercial, and defense aircraft.",[["53f383a3dabfae4b34a05024",null,null,null,"Nathan C.

Over a two-year period we collected field study data from multiple samples of information systems project teams-in all, 52 virtual teams comprising 318 students from the United States, Great Britain, and Hong Kong. As we hypothesized, group potency and computer collective efficacy act as antecedents to virtual team efficacy, and virtual team efficacy is in turn predictive of perceptual and objective measures of performance. Further, consistent with efficacy theory, we also find that virtual team efficacy acts on performance outcomes through specific mediating processes.

initio predictions of secondary structures in proteins have to combine local predictions, based on short fragments of the protein sequence, with consistency restrictions, as not all locally plausible predictions may be simultaneously true. We use the fact that secondary structures are patterns of hydrogen bonds and that a single residue can participate in hydrogen bonds of at most one secondary structure. Consistency of fixed-sized pieces of secondary structures is the easiest to approximate and we formalize it as 1-2 matching problem. Consistency of entire secondary structures is a version of set packing. We also investigate how to form a simple problem if we add the requirement that the secondary structure and the loops that connect them fit together in a metric space. Every problem that we investigated is MAX-SNP hard and it has a constant factor approximation. Computational experience suggests that in biological instances, we can find nearly optimal solutions using heuristics.</td><td>List(List(53f45d3adabfaee0d9c0cb90, null, berman@cse.psu.edu, 5b86b6c2e1cd8e14a34ca959, Piotr Berman, null, null, null, null, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA, null, 5f71b2d91c455f439fe3eb4f, List(Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA), null, null), List(53f436cbdabfaedf43582e9f, null, null, 5b86b6c2e1cd8e14a34ca959, Jieun Jeong, null, null, null, null, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA, null, 5f71b2d91c455f439fe3eb4f, List(Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA), null, null))</td><td>10.1007/s00453-007-9068-8</td><td>List(Algorithm, Heuristics, Set packing, Metric space, Ab initio, Hydrogen bond, Protein secondary structure, Mathematics, Protein structure, Theory of computation)</td><td></td><td>0178-4617</td><td>1</td><td>List(Secondary Structure, Maximum Weight, Local Prediction, Horizontal Edge, Connector Edge)</td><td>en</td><td>2</td><td>34</td><td>16</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9bdcdb7602d9704a7e6ae, 53e99d5eb7602d970261a1c4, 53e9bdcdb7602d9704a7e6ae, 53e99e3eb7602d970270422e, 53e9adffb7602d970380a762, 53e9b593b7602d97040d9071, 53e99c6fb7602d9702522122, 55a43e58612ca648688dc943, 53e99822b7602d97020431be)</td><td>Consistent Sets of Secondary Structures in Proteins</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00453-007-9068-8, http://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/s00453-007-9068-8, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00453-007-9068-8, https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3118965&picked=prox&preflayout=flat, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(539078f220f770854f5a882f, null, null, null, null, null, null, Algorithmica, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>53</td><td>2009</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>53e99960b7602d97021a53fa</td><td>In this work a new method of feature extraction for an interactive and adaptive recognizer for on-line handwritten alphanumeric characters has been proposed.

The features are extracted from dynamically changing locations of the writing device. The new method of feature extraction is simple, computationally light and fast enough for adaptive on-line use. Extracted features are robust with respect to all possible distortions like shape, size, and orientation. For simulation experiment, numerals 0-9 are used. A single hidden layer feed forward neural network trained by Quickprop algorithm, a variation of error back propagation is used for recognition. Very high recognition rates, even for highly distorted samples have been achieved confirming high generalization capability of the extracted feature set.</td><td>List(List(53f36626dabfae4b3499aa7a, null, null, 5b86b9c0e1cd8e14a3625bbe, Basabi Chakraborty, null, null, null, null, Faculty of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University, 152-52 Aza Sugo, Takizawamura, Iwate 020-0193, Japan, null, 5f71b4211c455f439fe47d1e, List(Faculty of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University, 152-52 Aza Sugo, Takizawamura, Iwate 020-0193, Japan), null, null), List(53f428c6dabfaeb22f3d18be, null, null, 5b86b9c0e1cd8e14a3625bbe, Goutam Chakraborty, null, null, null, null, Faculty of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University, 152-52 Aza Sugo, Takizawamura, Iwate 020-0193, Japan, null, 5f71b4211c455f439fe47d1e, List(Corresponding author, Faculty of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University, 152-52 Aza Sugo, Takizawamura, Iwate 020-0193, Japan), null, null))</td><td>10.1016/S0020-0255(02)00276-1</td><td>List(Alphanumeric, Feedforward neural network, Pattern recognition, Computer science, Data processing system, Feature extraction, Feature (machine learning), Artificial intelligence, Backpropagation, Artificial neural network, Quickprop)</td><td></td><td>0020-0255</td><td>1-4</td><td>List(adaptive on-line use, data processing system, feature extraction, inputting data, on-line recognition, handwritten alphanumeric character, feature set, new feature extraction technique, extracted feature, adaptive recognizer, new method, high generalization capability, high recognition rate, feed forward neural network, error back propagation, simulation experiment, data processing, artificial neural network)</td><td>en</td><td>19</td><td>70</td><td>55</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e998f6b7602d9702131ac1, 53e9a7acb7602d97030ebcb1, 53e9bd5ab7602d97049f4d54, 53e9b76eb7602d9704316bdc, 53e9a381b7602d9702c90ad0, 557d555c6feeaa8086da9ac9, 53e9a88cb7602d97031d8e96)</td><td>A new feature extraction technique for on-line recognition of handwritten alphanumeric characters</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0020-0255(02)00276-1, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025502002761)</td><td>List(555036b77cea80f95414b7e3, null, null, null, null, null, null, Inf.

Multimedia streams and Peer to Peer P2P file sharing dominates the worldwide Internet traffic nowadays and will continue further Schulze, 2009. The user acceptance of enjoying multimedia content over the Internet will grow steadily together with the increasing quality of the available multimedia content. Network operators and service providers have to face the growths by increasing their service platform with higher performance and bandwidth or introducing a scalable solution.

Wireless control and ATM signaling capabilities required for mobility support are discussed, and preliminary solutions are given for selected major functions. Potential extensions to standard Q.2931 ATM signaling are proposed to support handoff and service parameter/QoS renegotiation required for mobility.

In this paper, we have carried out series of intensive experiments at classrooms of Sumiyoshi Elementary School (7 or 8 years old; 83 subjects). The results are summarized as follows: 1) Devices the children use to learn do not affect the performance just after the study; 2) the PC use is effective when the target characters are complex and similar; and 3) The PC users keep remembering difficult shapes of characters after one month.

This approach has the advantage that some trade-offs between important properties of Boolean functions can be relaxed.</td><td>List(List(53f31948dabfae9a8442aa0a, null, an.braeken@kuleuven.ac.be, 5b868c4be1cd8e14a331b2d6, An Braeken, null, null, null, 0000-0002-9965-915X, Department Electrical Engineering, ESAT/COSIC, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee-Leuven, Belgium, null, 5f71b50b1c455f439fe4e5d9, null, null, null), List(562ce51645cedb3398cf69a5, null, null, 5b86b4ade1cd8e14a33d74e9, Ventzislav Nikov, null, null, null, null, Department of Mathematics and Computing Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, null, 5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5ce, null, null, null), List(53f43b58dabfaeb22f4a192a, null, null, 5b868c4be1cd8e14a331b2d6, Svetla Nikova, null, null, null, null, Department Electrical Engineering, ESAT/COSIC, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee-Leuven, Belgium, null, 5f71b50b1c455f439fe4e5d9, null, null, null), List(54872375dabfae9b40134250, null, null, 5b868c4be1cd8e14a331b2d6, Bart Preneel, null, null, null, 0000-0003-2005-9651, Department Electrical Engineering, ESAT/COSIC, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee-Leuven, Belgium, null, 5f71b50b1c455f439fe4e5d9, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1007/978-3-540-30556-9_11</td><td>List(Boolean network, Boolean function, Boolean algebras canonically defined, Computer science, Cryptography, Parity function, Cardinality, Standard Boolean model, Monotone polygon, Discrete mathematics, Boolean circuit, Algebra, Product term, Boolean expression, Two-element Boolean algebra)</td><td>3-540-24130-2</td><td>0302-9743</td><td></td><td>List(boolean function, better insight, new definitions result, boolean functions, resiliency, cryptographic property, propagation characteristic, important property, possible monotone set, mono- tone sets, better understanding, generalized cryptographic property, propagation characteristics, usual definition, specific monotone set)</td><td>en</td><td>35</td><td>135</td><td>120</td><td>//static.aminer.org/pdf/PDF/000/399/353/on_boolean_functions_with_generalized_cryptographic_properties.pdf</td><td>List(53e99a73b7602d97022e0f6b, 53e9ac42b7602d9703610b10, 53e9bb44b7602d9704786d28, 53e9bd4bb7602d97049dedbb, 53e99fa2b7602d970287affc, 53e9b822b7602d97043db76a, 53e9a7c8b7602d9703103e62, 599c77e8601a182cd2589291, 53e9b746b7602d97042e1b81, 557e7a116fee0fe990ca9e09, 557e8355d19faf961d16a410, 53e9a255b7602d9702b5c27b, 53e9b2ccb7602d9703d7b340, 558abbcee4b031bae1f95c0e, 557fb885f6678c77ea22b1ca, 53e9b123b7602d9703ba101f, 53e9a8dbb7602d970322a6bd, 53e9a263b7602d9702b67330, 53e9ae7db7602d970389a6b7, 573697c06e3b12023e6a15ee, 53e9bbadb7602d97047f860b, 53e99827b7602d970204b679, 53e9ae90b7602d97038b2e10, 53e99809b7602d970201ea92, 53e9a335b7602d9702c3d436, 53e9a46bb7602d9702d88707, 53e9b444b7602d9703f406df, 53e9b109b7602d9703b88d29, 53e9a8eab7602d970323c2bd, 53e9ba7db7602d97046a1e28)</td><td>On boolean functions with generalized cryptographic properties</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-30556-9_11, http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/259, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(555036ba7cea80f95414cf96, null, null, null, null, null, null, IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>2004</td><td>2004</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a5829</td><td>An XML brokerage system is a distributed XML database system that comprises data sources and brokers which, respectively, hold XML documents and document distribution information.

As a result, access control deployment strategies (in terms of where and when to do access control) and the impact of such strategies on end-to-end system performance are neglected by existing information brokerage systems. In addition, data source side access control deployment is taken-for-granted as the \"right\" thing to do. In this paper, we challenge this traditional, taken-for-granted access control deployment methodology, and argue that query brokering and access control are not two orthogonal issues because access control deployment strategies can have a significant impact on the \"whole\" system's end-to-end performance.

In this paper, we examine closely the problem of mining sequential patterns and propose a general evaluation method to assess the quality of the mined results. We propose four evaluation criteria, namely (1) recoverability, (2) the number of spurious patterns (3) the number of redundant patterns, and (4) the degree of extraneous items in the patterns, to quantitatively assess the quality of the mined results from a wide variety of synthetic datasets with varying randomness and noise levels. Recoverability, a new metric, measures how much of the underlying trend has been detected. Such an evaluation method provides a basis for comparing different models for sequential pattern mining. Furthermore, such evaluation is essential in understanding the performance of approximate solutions. In this paper, the method is employed to conduct a detailed comparison of the traditional frequent sequential pattern model with an alternative approximate pattern model based on sequence alignment. We demonstrate that the alternative approach is able to better recover the underlying patterns with little confounding information under all circumstances we examined, including those where the frequent sequential pattern model fails.</td><td>List(List(53f42ba3dabfaedd74d1bd9e, null, kum@cs.unc.edu, 5b86b8eee1cd8e14a35c5613, Hye-Chung (Monica) Kum, null, null, null, null, Computer Science University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill North Carolina, null, 5f71b2891c455f439fe3c8db, null, null, null), List(53f479dddabfae8a6845c64e, null, null, 5b86b8eee1cd8e14a35c5613, Susan Paulsen, null, null, null, null, Computer Science University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill North Carolina, null, 5f71b2891c455f439fe3c8db, null, null, null), List(5602421a45cedb3395f4c6e6, null, null, 5b86b8eee1cd8e14a35c5613, Wei Wang, null, null, null, null, Computer Science University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill North Carolina, null, 5f71b2891c455f439fe3c8db, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1007/11498186_3</td><td>List(Data mining, Confounding, Evaluation methods, Computer science, Knowledge extraction, Spurious relationship, Sequential Pattern Mining, Randomness)</td><td></td><td>1860-949X</td><td></td><td>List(sequential pattern mining, sequence alignment)</td><td>en</td><td>10</td><td>70</td><td>43</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9a0b5b7602d970299c046, 53e99c44b7602d97024f6215, 53e9a07ab7602d9702966154, 53e99a2fb7602d97022886af, 53e9b862b7602d970442d562, 53e9a61fb7602d9702f4def1, 53e9a4b8b7602d9702dd9d62, 53e9abf7b7602d97035b98cd, 53e99845b7602d970207221c, 53e9ab48b7602d97034dcbe2, 53e9a8b0b7602d97031fba42, 53e9b8eeb7602d97044d1c33, 53e9b8a1b7602d970447e325, 53e9a749b7602d97030803e0, 53e99a67b7602d97022d4aa2, 53e9a2bab7602d9702bc3399)</td><td>Comparative Study of Sequential Pattern Mining Models</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11498186_3, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(null, 1860-949X, null, null, null, 1860-9503, null, STUDIES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, null, STUDIES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, null, J, null)</td><td>6</td><td>2005</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a583f</td><td>  Reference resolution is one of the important tasks in natural language processing.

Previous work could handle only strictly shallower circuits (e.g. those with depth O(\\sqrt{\\lg n}) [SYY99, V76]. We present three protocols -- UGP-Match, FSGP-Match and OFSGP-Match -- all three are based on (2-decomposable randomized encodings of) group programs and handle circuits in NC1.

This paper presents a technique that integrates Case-Based Reasoning and Bayesian Networks to build user profiles incrementally. Case-Based Reasoning provides a mechanism to acquire knowledge about user actions that are worth recording to determine his habits and preferences.

Switch requirements are particularly important in conventional VLSI where (a) a switchpoint consumes considerably more area than a wire crossing and (b) switchpoints must reside on the active surface, whereas wiring may take place on any of several wire layers. The most straight-forward, limited-bisection switching networks have switching requirements which grow as $O(N^{2p})$, similar to wiring requirements.

Due to large deformation involved between prone and supine, either non-rigid intensity-based mage registration methods or biomechanical model based methods alone have limited success. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid finite element method (FEM) based image registration method by combining patient-specific biomechanical models with nonrigid intensity-based image registration methods.

Applied to IGBTs, this process can minimize the magnitude of the current tail during turn-off when the temperature increases. The goal of the local lifetime control is to minimize the rise of the gain of the PNP bipolar transistor as well as the rise of the minority carrier lifetime, To evaluate the efficiency of that process, the following study presents a comparative analysis of turn-off switching performances for hard- and soft-switching at high temperature of 1200V new types of IGBT. In order to give an over-view of the local lifetime control process effect, both trench and new planar IGBTs performances have been investigated at high temperature and compared to conventional planar IGBT using global lifetime control. Current and voltage waveforms and turn-off switching losses are analyzed. Results show that the local lifetime control process is very efficient under hard-switching and zero-voltage switching, but this is not the case under zero-current switching, especially for the new planar IGBT.

Tests are performed upon the syntactic structure of the process control system to choose an appropriate template. fn our system, the template can be viewed as a series of small functions, each of which generates one part of a sentence (noun phrase, verb phrase, etc.), and which are executed in a particular sequence in order to produce output. The ordering of the execution can be varied depending on the values of NLG system variables representing such thiigs as the tense of the utterance to be generated, and which have their values set during dte process of template choice.

Interrupt, however, is expensive and may not be available in user-level communication protocols. This paper studies the performance of software DSMs using threads instead of interrupt for communication. We implement three thread communication methods in the JIAJIA software DSM. The first method separates a communication thread from the main thread, the second one divides the communication thread into a sending thread and a receiving thread, and the third method further splits a serving thread from the receiving thread. The effect of the thread communication methods is evaluated in a PC cluster and a cluster of PowerPC workstations with some well-accepted benchmarks. Evaluation results show that the performance of thread communication is slightly worse than that of interrupt communication when there is only one processor to run a process, but is better than that of interrupt communication when there are more than one processors in a node to run a process. The thread communication method with one sending thread and one receiving thread achieves the best performance inthethree thread communication methods. Besides, the effect of the thread communication is also related to the operating system. Analysis of the evaluation results reveals that the waiting time constitutes the major overhead of the execution, and the dominant factor that in uence waiting time is neither the interrupt overhead nor the thread switching overhead but the responsiveness of requests (i.e., whether requests can be processed and replied promptly).</td><td>List(List(53f435c2dabfaee0d9b60374, null, null, null, Weiwu Hu Gang Shi, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f43f1adabfaedf435b948a, null, null, null, Fuxin Zhang, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td></td><td>List(Interrupt, Asynchronous communication, Win32 Thread Information Block, Computer science, Electronic mail, Thread (computing), Thread safety, Spinlock, Operating system, Fiber (computer science))</td><td>0-7695-1116-3</td><td></td><td></td><td>List()</td><td>en</td><td>5</td><td>149</td><td>149</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9b36cb7602d9703e4982c, 53e9b708b7602d970429fa17, 53e9a8f9b7602d9703248078, 53e9b44ab7602d9703f431c7, 53e9bd50b7602d97049e5c58, 53e9afe8b7602d9703a3c2d4, 53e9b54ab7602d9704083364, 53e99818b7602d9702034374, 53e9af40b7602d9703980b1e, 53e998c7b7602d97020ff4c0)</td><td>Communication with Threads in Software DSMs</td><td>List(http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/CLUSTR.2001.959967)</td><td>List(555037037cea80f95416df55, null, null, Foundations of Computer Science, null, null, null, CLUSTER, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2001</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a5705</td><td>In today's scenario most of the programs are interdisciplinary in nature.

However, providing this service is a nontrivial task because of the lack of infrastructure and node limitations. Existing techniques distribute secret keys to the network users through a trusted third party or using computationally-complex public-key methods. An alternative approach is pre-distributing keying material to the nodes prior to the network deployment. Exploiting the mathematical properties of symmetric polynomials, we propose a multivariate key pre-distribution scheme (MKPS) in this paper. In this scheme, using uniquely assigned IDs, shares of d-variate polynomials are stored into the memory of every sensor. After the network deployment, every two neighbor nodes at the unit Hamming distance of each other establish exactly d-1 common keys without any interaction with a third party in the network. The final secret key used by these nodes is a symmetric combination of all the common keys. We will show that this feature significantly improves the security of the MKPS over previous schemes. The proposed method is in the category of threshold schemes, i.e., it remains perfectly secure up to the capture of a certain fraction of sensor nodes. We also propose a location-aware MKPS in which, by taking advantage of the location information, perfect connectivity is achieved. The new location-aware scheme is a cell-based method in which nodes are randomly deployed within hexagonal cells. Nodes are unaware of their exact locations. Nevertheless, they know the coordinates of their residing cells. One MKPS is used to secure communications within every cell and one to secure communications between cells. This location-based scheme significantly improves the resiliency of the network against the node capture.</td><td>List(List(53f4374bdabfaeb22f4797b3, null, null, 5b86b74de1cd8e14a35090de, Farshid Delgosha, null, null, null, null, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, null, 5f71b4f61c455f439fe4dc1a, null, null, null), List(53f443bedabfaee4dc7c68e3, null, null, 5b86b74de1cd8e14a35090de, Erman Ayday, null, null, null, null, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, null, 5f71b4f61c455f439fe4dc1a, null, null, null), List(5448d34adabfae87b7e80998, null, null, 5b86b74de1cd8e14a35090de, Faramarz Fekri, null, null, null, null, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, null, 5f71b4f61c455f439fe4dc1a, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1145/1280940.1280992</td><td>List(Symmetric-key algorithm, Key distribution in wireless sensor networks, Trusted third party, Polynomial, Computer science, Keying, Computer network, Hamming distance, Symmetric polynomial, Wireless sensor network, Distributed computing)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>List(location-based scheme, network deployment, multivariate polynomial scheme, sensor node, previous scheme, symmetric key-establishment, multivariate key pre-distribution scheme, network user, location-aware mkps, threshold scheme, new location-aware scheme, sensor network, hamming distance, secure communication, symmetric polynomial, public key, wireless sensor network, trusted third party)</td><td>en</td><td>15</td><td>241</td><td>236</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9b976b7602d9704564326, 53e9a34ab7602d9702c55421, 53e9a699b7602d9702fce2ac, 53e999d8b7602d970221b545, 53e9a79eb7602d97030d70e5, 53e9b8efb7602d97044d5156, 53e9b428b7602d9703f2064b, 53e99a79b7602d97022e998f, 53e9a603b7602d9702f30c67, 53e9b572b7602d97040afdf3, 5a79a6780a3ac53e09b8e48c, 53e9b672b7602d97041dbe1d)</td><td>MKPS: a multivariate polynomial scheme for symmetric key-establishment in distributed sensor networks</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1280940.1280992, http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1280940.1280992)</td><td>List(5550372d7cea80f954178698, null, null, International Conference on Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, null, null, null, IWCMC, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2007</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a58e8</td><td>A speaker model in speaker recognition system is to be trained from a large data set gathered in multiple sessions.

In this paper, we propose an incremental robust adaptation method to minimize the influence of outliers on Gaussian Mixture Model based speaker model.

Second, some constraint combinations when used with traditional agglomerative algorithms can cause the dendrogram to stop prematurely in a dead-end solution even though there exist other feasible solutions with a significantly smaller number of clusters. When constraints lead to efficiently solvable feasibility problems and standard agglomerative algorithms do not give rise to dead-end solutions, we empirically illustrate the benefits of using constraints to improve cluster purity and average distortion.

Existing algorithms may be arranged along an axis indi- cating how global the motion model used to constrain tracks is. Local methods, such as the KLT tracker, depend on lo- cal models of feature appearance, and are easily distracted by occlusions, repeated structure, and image noise. This leads to short tracks, many of which are incorrect. Alone, these require considerable postprocessing to obtain a use- ful result. In restricted scenes, for example a rigid scene through which a camera is moving, such postprocessing can make use of global motion models to allow \"guided match- ing\" which yields long high-quality feature tracks. How- ever, many scenes of interest contain multiple motions or significant non-rigid deformations which mean that guided matching cannot be applied. In this paper we propose a general amalgam of local and global models to improve tracking even in these diffi- cult cases. By viewing rank-constrained tracking as a prob- abilistic model of 2D tracks rather than 3D motion, we ob- tain a strong, robust motion prior, derived from the global motion in the scene. The result is a simple and powerful prior whose strength is easily tuned, enabling its use in any existing tracking algorithm.</td><td>List(List(53f43c0ddabfaee1c0ad20a2, null, null, null, Aeron Buchanan, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f560cfdabfae5b0ff8045b, null, null, null, Andrew W.

In this paper we present more evidence to the value of such representations. Our results hinge on the notion of relevance, and model based representations are shown to be useful in capturing relevant information, and in allowing to ignore irrelevant information. In particular, we consider situations where context-specific information is used in the process of reasoning. We show that reasoning with model-based representations can be done efficiently in the presence of varying context information. We then consider the task of default reasoning. We show that default reasoning is a generalization of reasoning within context, in which the reasoner has many ``context\" rules, which may be conflicting. We develop model-based algorithms that handle efficiently fragments of Reiter''s default logic. Our intuition about relevance is best captured in the model for reasoning within context, where model-based representations enable us to filter out irrelevant information. Interestingly, default logic is somewhat in contrast with our intuition about relevance. Default rules do not tell us explicitly what the context information is. Instead, we have to figure out what are the possible ``extensions\" and then use those as possible contexts. As we show, model-based representations capture all possible extensions in an accessible form, thereby supporting efficient default reasoning whenever possible. Lastly, we argue that these results support an incremental view of reasoning in a natural way. We discuss the Learning to Reason framework, which emphasizes this view, and the notion of relevance as manifested in it.

We demonstrate our approach with edits of long sequences of dynamic actions, including kicks, jumps, and spins.</td><td>List(List(53f3aa6cdabfae4b34af36a0, null, null, 5b868cb1e1cd8e14a33442d6, Kwang Won Sok, null, null, null, null, Seoul National University and Carnegie Mellon University and Disney Research Pittsburgh, null, 5f71b2861c455f439fe3c771, null, null, null), List(53f469cbdabfaedd74e775a3, null, null, 5b86b45de1cd8e14a33b2124, Katsu Yamane, null, null, null, null, Disney Research Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, null, 5f71b2861c455f439fe3c771, null, null, null), List(53f4d97edabfaef64c77b926, null, null, 5b86b6c0e1cd8e14a34c99b7, Jehee Lee, null, null, null, null, Seoul National University, null, 5f71b2901c455f439fe3cbb6, null, null, null), List(53f451fedabfaec09f1f5fcc, null, null, 5b86bd16e1cd8e14a37a7057, Jessica Hodgins, null, null, null, null, Carnegie Mellon University and Disney Research Pittsburgh, null, 5f71b2861c455f439fe3c771, null, null, null))</td><td>10.5555/1921427.1921430</td><td>List(Spins, Motion capture, User control, Normalization (statistics), Computer graphics (images), Trajectory optimization, Vertical direction, Computer science, Momentum, Jump)</td><td>978-1-4503-0923-3</td><td></td><td></td><td>List(intuitive editing tool, linear momentum, external force, interactive editing, user control, motion capture sequence, dynamic motion, dynamic human motion, dynamic action, propagate momentum, normalized dynamic, motion capture, trajectory optimization)</td><td>en</td><td>50</td><td>20</td><td>11</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9a357b7602d9702c63829, 5e8d8dd59fced0a24b5d3e6c, 53e9b3abb7602d9703e8cebc, 53e9a2acb7602d9702bb228c, 53e9b54fb7602d9704085c3e, 53e9ad72b7602d970375dcad, 53e99a67b7602d97022d252f, 53e99cbbb7602d970256ede3, 558c4f07e4b00c3c48e18996, 53e9bb5ab7602d970479a2f6, 53e997f8b7602d9701fff287, 558a6525e4b0b32fcb368ef9, 557e4e15d19faf961d168b1d, 53e9a026b7602d970290a37c, 558aa50184ae84d265bed096, 53e9bc3bb7602d97048adf09, 53e9b4e4b7602d970400d8df, 53e9ba76b7602d9704696e10, 53e9982cb7602d9702053f3c, 53e99d2fb7602d97025e37e2, 53e9ab31b7602d97034bb81a, 53e9a6a0b7602d9702fd58c3)</td><td>Editing dynamic human motions via momentum and force</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.2312/SCA/SCA10/011-019, https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/1921427.1921430)</td><td>List(5390976220f70186a0dfe8e9, null, null, null, null, null, null, Symposium on Computer Animation 2004, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2010</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a590b</td><td>Sinhala writing system used in Sri Lanka is a syllabic writing system deriving from Brahmi and it consists of vowels, consonants, diacritical marks, and special symbols.

It is necessary to locate the technical patterns in the stock price movement charts to analyze the market behavior. Indeed, there are two main problems: how to define those preferred patterns (technical patterns) for query and how to match the defined pattern templates in different resolutions. As we can see, defining the similarity between time series (or time series subsequences) is of fundamental importance. By identifying the perceptually important points (PIPs) directly from the time domain, time series and templates of different lengths can be compared. Three ways of distance measure, including Euclidean distance (PIP-ED), perpendicular distance (PIP-PD) and vertical distance (PIP-VD), for PIP identification are compared in this paper. After the PIP identification process, both template- and rule-based pattern-matching approaches are introduced. The proposed methods are distinctive in their intuitiveness, making them particularly user friendly to ordinary data analysts like stock market investors. As demonstrated by the experiments, the template- and the rule-based time series matching and subsequence searching approaches provide different directions to achieve the goal of pattern identification.</td><td>List(List(53f43525dabfaeb22f466c97, null, cstcfu@comp.polyu.edu.hk, 5b86c9f1e1cd8e14a3d6d552, Tak-chung Fu, null, null, null, null, Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hunghom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, null, 5f71b2961c455f439fe3ce47, List(Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hunghom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Corresponding author.

The values of attributes defined for each pair [object, attribute], called descriptors, are assumed to be unique and precise. In practice, however, these attribute values may be neither unique nor precise, i.e. they can be uncertain. We are distinguishing four types of uncertainty affecting values of attributes: uncertain discretization of quantitative attributes, imprecision of values of numerical attributes, unknown (missing) values of attributes, multiple values possible for one pair [object, attribute]. We propose a special way of modelling the first three types of uncertainty using fuzzy sets, which boils them down to the fourth type, called shortly, multiple descriptors. Thus, the generalization of the rough set approach consists in handling the case of multiple descriptors for both condition and decision attributes. The generalization preserves all characteristic features of the rough set approach while enabling reasoning about uncertain data.

However, large-scale MS faces the potential problem of mass degeneracy---indistinguishable masses for multiple biopolymer fragments (e.g., from a limited proteolytic digest). This paper studies the tasks of planning and interpreting MS experiments that use selective isotopic labeling, thereby substantially reducing potential mass degeneracy. Our algorithms support an experimental--computational protocol called structure-activity relation by mass spectrometry (SAR by MS) for elucidating the function of protein-DNA and protein-protein complexes. SAR by MS enzymatically cleaves a crosslinked complex and analyzes the resulting mass spectrum for mass peaks of hypothesized fragments. Depending on binding mode, some cleavage sites will be shielded; the absence of anticipated peaks implicates corresponding fragments as either part of the interaction region or inaccessible due to conformational change upon binding. Thus, different mass spectra provide evidence for different structure--activity relations. We address combinatorial and algorithmic questions in the areas of data analysis (constraining binding mode based on mass signature) and experiment planning (determining an isotopic labeling strategy to reduce mass degeneracy and aid data analysis). We explore the computational complexity of these problems, obtaining upper and lower bounds. We report experimental results from implementations of our algorithms.</td><td>List(List(53f432c3dabfaeb22f44c347, null, null, null, C Bailey-Kellogg, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f42f5fdabfaee2a1c957e4, null, null, null, J J Kelley, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f435fadabfaee1c0a99ee3, null, null, null, C Stein, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(548a4866dabfaed7b5fa40a4, null, brd@cs.dartmouth.edu, null, B R Donald, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1089/106652701300099056</td><td>List(Biological system, Upper and lower bounds, Mass spectrum, Isotopic labeling, Degeneracy (mathematics), Proteome, Mass spectrometry, Bioinformatics, Computational complexity theory, Cleavage (embryo), Physics)</td><td>1-57735-115-0</td><td>1066-5277</td><td>1</td><td>List(stable isotope)</td><td>en</td><td>19</td><td>36</td><td>19</td><td>//static.aminer.org/pdf/PDF/000/438/276/reducing_mass_degeneracy_in_sar_by_ms_by_stable_isotopic.pdf</td><td>List(53e99a67b7602d97022d2cf8, 53e99ab2b7602d970232c74f, 53e9bbe0b7602d9704832a7f, 53e9a216b7602d9702b1817b, 53e9997eb7602d97021c01d8, 53e9aadfb7602d970345edab, 53e9abbeb7602d970356b743, 53e9ba33b7602d9704643b29)</td><td>Reducing mass degeneracy in SAR by MS by stable isotopic labeling.</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/106652701300099056, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10977062?report=xml&format=text, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11339904?report=xml&format=text, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(54824ca9582fc50b5e00b6f4, null, null, null, null, null, null, Journal of Computational Biology, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>8</td><td>2001</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a5950</td><td></td><td>List(List(53f318efdabfae9a84428a6a, null, null, null, Kenichi Maruyama, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f39d63dabfae4b34aa33b7, null, null, null, Koji Oka, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f4502ddabfaec09f1ee925, null, null, null, Ryuichi Takase, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f45fe0dabfaedce55d0f9a, null, null, null, Yoshihiro Kawai, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f42d11dabfaeb22f403c54, null, null, null, Takashi Yoshimi, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(5409765adabfae450f488bc1, null, null, null, Hironobu Takahashi, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(5434e71edabfaebba587b162, null, null, null, Fumiaki Tomita, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761594</td><td>List(Data modeling, Object detection, Computer vision, Surface of revolution, Curve fitting, Iterative method, Object model, Artificial intelligence, Pixel, Mathematics, Quadric)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>List(curve fitting, feature extraction, iterative methods, object detection, stereo image processing, 3D localization, area-based stereo matching, iterative method, maximum curvature, minimum curvature, partially buried object, unstructured environment)</td><td>en</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9b2ffb7602d9703dc195f, 558a55d5e4b0b32fcb3633a4, 53e9b95bb7602d9704545201, 53e9bb29b7602d97047674e4, 557d9088d19faf961d161d0b, 53e9a797b7602d97030d5222)</td><td>3D localization of partially buried object in unstructured environment</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761594, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4761594)</td><td>List(555037617cea80f95418423f, null, null, International Conference on Pattern Recognition, null, null, null, ICPR, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2008</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a595a</td><td></td><td>List(List(53f31ce8dabfae9a8443f452, null, null, null, Noureddine Boussiala, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f43404dabfaee4dc76bb57, null, null, null, A.

However, according to existing strongest receiving signal association method, pico cells with the extremely low transmitting power are significantly limited in the presence of macro coverage. Thus, the new introduced pico frequency resource will not be fully exploited in this unbalanced user distributions among macro and pico cells. In this paper, by jointly considering the long term channel condition and load balance in this macro-pico coexisted heterogeneous network, we formulate the cell selection problem into a network-wide proportional fairness optimization. Both optimal solution (by dynamic programming) and cost efficient algorithm (greedy heuristics) are proposed. In 3GPP LTE-A heterogeneous network scenario, the system-level performance evaluation shows that, compared with the conventional strongest signal cell selection scheme, the proposed optimized fairness cell selection methods could achieve significant performance gains especially for the cell edge users. © 2011 IEEE.</td><td>List(List(53f4a8b9dabfaeb22f57485c, null, null, null, Jun Wang, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(5405e6e3dabfae91d301a742, null, null, null, Jianguo Liu, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f436b6dabfaedd74da36bd, null, null, null, Dongyao Wang, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f444b5dabfaee4dc7ca574, null, null, null, Jiyong Pang, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f43316dabfaedd74d7e567, null, null, null, Gang Shen, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1109/VETECF.2011.6092994</td><td>List(Load balancing (computing), Computer network, Bandwidth (signal processing), Cellular network, Heterogeneous network, Engineering, Macro, Channel capacity, LTE Advanced, Telecommunications link)</td><td></td><td></td><td>null</td><td>List(cost effectiveness, cellular network, signal to noise ratio, heuristic algorithm, downlink, heterogeneous network, greedy heuristic, proportional fair, scheduling, cost efficiency, channel capacity, interference, bandwidth, load balance)</td><td>en</td><td>60</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9b304b7602d9703dcb639, 53e9a584b7602d9702eac676, 53e9b31bb7602d9703de82c0, 558a30fde4b031bae1f63058, 53e9a26bb7602d9702b741bc, 558aaf9fe4b0b32fcb384499, 53e9b5afb7602d97040f3019, 53e9b708b7602d970429b6a1)</td><td>Optimized Fairness Cell Selection for 3GPP LTE-A Macro-Pico HetNets.</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VETECF.2011.6092994)</td><td>List(555037327cea80f954179453, null, null, Vehicular Technology Conference, null, null, null, VTC Fall, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>null</td><td>2011</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a57cf</td><td></td><td>List(List(53f42b55dabfaeb2acfc9713, null, null, null, Hideki Sawaguchi, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f444cbdabfaeb22f4b91a2, null, null, null, Morishi Izumita, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f439f2dabfaeb22f491d17, null, null, null, Seiichi Mita, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1109/GLOCOM.2003.1258964</td><td>List(Sequential decoding, Soft output Viterbi algorithm, Computer science, Communication channel, Algorithm, Speech recognition, Decoding methods, Iterative Viterbi decoding, Detector, Viterbi algorithm, Computation)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>List(Viterbi detection, data recording, decoding, digital magnetic recording, magnetic recording noise, maximum likelihood detection, ML detector, PRML channels, Viterbi detection, computational complexity, data-dependent media noise, high-density recording, high-speed circuit implementation, lookup-table architecture, magnetic recording systems, media-noise soft-output decoding, post-processing decoding, recording channels, signal-dependent correlation-sensitive metric estimation, soft-output data-detection, soft-output post-processing detection, sub-optimal maximum-likelihood sequence detection)</td><td>en</td><td>6</td><td>3920</td><td>3913</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9b3c1b7602d9703eab60d, 53e99cbcb7602d9702570f22, 53e99ddbb7602d970269cf57, 558a8cdce4b0b32fcb377b92, 53e9a6e6b7602d970301c717, 53e99f2db7602d97027f9466)</td><td>Soft-output post-processing detection for PRML channels in the presence of data-dependent media noise.</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2003.1258964, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1258964)</td><td>List(555037577cea80f954182982, null, null, Global Communications Conference, null, null, null, GLOBECOM, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>7</td><td>2003</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a57d0</td><td>In traditional accounting,cost is an accumulating process little by little but revenue is realized and recognized on a timeline.Though revenue matches cost,there are different notion about revenue and cost in accounting,which reflects that it is a flaw of traditional accounting theory.Based on the idea of accumulating and assigning cost with the production process and combining the latent customers’ state transformation under Electronic Commerce(EC) circumstances,the author present that revenue realization be a process and not be a point-in-time.

A list of query results in the form of subtrees will be returned to the users. However, we find that the traditional way of returning a list of subtrees to the users is still not sufficient to meet users' information needs because: (1) search intention of a keyword query can be different with different users issuing it; (2) amongst the query results, they may have sibling and containment relationships, which could be important for digesting the query results and should be displayed to the users as well. To address the problem, we propose a new exploration model MALEX to work as a complementary component of the XML keyword search engine, in order to enhance users' search experience.

To evaluate the error rate new Markov based models are proposed to account for the different types of bonding (i.e. single, double and triple) in the monomers as modification to the commonly assumed kinetic trap model.

This research is motivated in part by the potential application of speaker recognition technologies on handheld devices or the Internet. While the technologies promise an additional biometric layer of security to protect the user, the practical implementation of such systems faces many challenges. One of these is environmental noise. Due to the mobile nature of such systems, the noise sources can be highly time-varying and potentially unknown. This raises the requirement for noise robustness in the absence of information about the noise. This paper describes a method that combines multicondition model training and missing-feature theory to model noise with unknown temporal-spectral characteristics. Multicondition training is conducted using simulated noisy data with limited noise variation, providing a ldquocoarserdquo compensation for the noise, and missing-feature theory is applied to refine the compensation by ignoring noise variation outside the given training conditions, thereby reducing the training and testing mismatch. This paper is focused on several issues relating to the implementation of the new model for real-world applications. These include the generation of multicondition training data to model noisy speech, the combination of different training data to optimize the recognition performance, and the reduction of the model's complexity. The new algorithm was tested using two databases with simulated and realistic noisy speech data. The first database is a redevelopment of the TIMIT database by rerecording the data in the presence of various noise types, used to test the model for speaker identification with a focus on the varieties of noise. The second database is a handheld-device database collected in realistic noisy condi- tions, used to further validate the model for real-world speaker verification. The new model is compared to baseline systems and is found to achieve lower error rates.</td><td>List(List(54484ac2dabfae87b7e009e7, null, null, 5b86cf37e1cd8e14a3fd5138, Ji Ming, null, null, null, null, Queen's Univ.

The proposed framework considers seven important elements of the reverse logistics system. It is divided into three hierarchical levels (strategic, tactical, and operational). By carrying out experimentation with the proposed conceptual model, all three levels were tested in different industrial sectors during its development. Three real-world case studies are presented to test and to show the flexibility and applicability of the framework. The proposed conceptual framework will help practitioners in the field to structure their reverse logistics activities and also help academics in developing better decision models.</td><td>List(List(54312d4cdabfae8f2913488a, null, serge.lambert@uqtr.ca, 5b86b90ae1cd8e14a35d2898, Serge Lambert, null, null, null, null, Université du Québec í Trois-Rivières, Département de génie industriel, C.P. 500, Trois-Rivières, Québec, Canada G9A 5H7, null, 5f71b28d1c455f439fe3ca1c, List(Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, Département de génie industriel, C.P. 500, Trois-Rivières, Québec, Canada G9A 5H7, Tel.: +1 819 376 5011x3907; fax: +1 819 376 5070.), null, null), List(53f43a79dabfaee4dc7a92e9, null, diane.riopel@polymtl.ca, 5b86a372e1cd8e14a3caa71d, Diane Riopel, null, null, null, null, Departement of Mathematics and Industrial Engineering, ícole Polytechnique de Montréal, P.O.

Differing from other existing naming game models, in NGG everyone in the population (network) can be both speaker and hearer simultaneously, which resembles in a closer manner to real-life scenarios. Moreover, NGG allows the transmission (communication) of multiple words (opinions) for multiple intra-group consensuses. The communications among indirectly-connected nodes are also enabled in NGG. We simulated and analyzed the consensus process in some typical network topologies, including random-graph networks, small-world networks and scale-free networks, to better understand how global convergence (consensus) could be reached on one common word. The results are interpreted on group negotiation of a peer-to-peer network, which shows that global consensus in the population can be reached more rapidly when more opinions are permitted within each group or when the negotiating groups in the population are larger in size.

Approximation procedures, such as penalized quasi-likelihood, are computationally efficient, but the resulting estimators can be seriously biased for binary responses. Gauss-Hermite quadrature and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration based methods can yield more accurate estimation, but they are computationally much more intensive. Estimation methods that can achieve both computational efficiency and estimation accuracy are still under development. This paper proposes an efficient direct sampling based Monte Carlo EM algorithm (DSMCEM) for latent variable models with binary responses. Mixed effects and item factor analysis models with binary responses are used to illustrate this algorithm. Results from two simulation studies and a real data example suggest that, as compared with MCMC based EM, DSMCEM can significantly improve computational efficiency as well as produce equally accurate parameter estimates. Other aspects and extensions of the algorithm are discussed.</td><td>List(List(53f44eeedabfaedd74e107a9, null, axm@ucla.edu, 5b86a6e8e1cd8e14a3e057bc, Xinming An, null, null, null, null, Department of Psychology, UCLA, United States, null, 5f71b2851c455f439fe3c70a, List(Department of Psychology, UCLA, United States, Corresponding author.), null, null), List(54334d1cdabfaeb4c6ab5975, null, null, 5b8691ede1cd8e14a355b0db, Peter M.

This question has been tackled for various complex systems such as cellular automata, Boolean networks, neural networks but little is known for multi-agent systems, especially for the models with a complex behaviour which emerges from simple local rules. This paper focuses on a multi-turmite model, namely the multiple Langton's ants model. All the agents are updated simultaneously and the variation of the updating scheme consists only in choosing different strategies for solving the conflicts produced when two or more agents want to go on the same location. We show that for the same formulation of the agents' behaviour, and the same initial conditions, the use of different updating schemes may lead to qualitatively different evolutions of the system. As a positive spin-off of this study, we exhibit new phenomena of the multi-turmite model such as deadlocks or gliders.</td><td>List(List(53f4568edabfaee43ecbd693, null, null, 5b86c4f3e1cd8e14a3b2b326, Nazim Fatès, null, null, null, null, INRIA Nancy Grand-Est - LORIA, Villers-lès-Nancy, France, null, 5f71b29a1c455f439fe3d023, null, null, null), List(53f7c32bdabfae938c6d8cd7, null, null, 5b868e9de1cd8e14a3407efd, Vincent Chevrier, null, null, null, null, Nancy University UHP - LORIA, Vandoeuvre-lès-Nancy, France, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td></td><td>List(Complex system, Cellular automaton, Know-how, Computer science, Deadlock, Multi-agent system, Turmite, Artificial intelligence, Artificial neural network)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>List(complex behaviour, different strategy, different evolution, ants model, cellular automaton, multi-turmite model, multi-agent system, open question, boolean network, various complex system, neural network, multi agent system, complex system, cellular automata, initial condition, complex systems)</td><td>en</td><td>8</td><td>540</td><td>533</td><td>https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/1373/200/144/53e99967b7602d97021a5bd2_0.pdf</td><td>List(53e9b0ccb7602d9703b45111, 53e9a3fbb7602d9702d13365, 53e9a6a0b7602d9702fd4fe8, 53e9aa86b7602d97033fc96e, 53e9a6f5b7602d970302ccad, 53e99e28b7602d97026eca95, 53e9a3fbb7602d9702d14a59, 53e9bbeab7602d97048414c8, 53e9a335b7602d9702c40898, 53e9a1bdb7602d9702ab66b9, 53e9bbfbb7602d9704857d58)</td><td>How important are updating schemes in multi-agent systems?

We aim to find video according to higher level similarities, which is beyond the scope of traditional near duplicate search. Following the popular hashing technique we employ compact binary codes to facilitate nearest neighbor search. Unlike the previous methods which capitalize on only one type of hash code for retrieval, this paper combines heterogeneous hash codes to effectively describe the diverse and multi-scale visual contents in videos. Our method integrates feature pooling and hashing in a single framework. In the pooling stage, we cast video frames into a set of pre-specified components, which capture a variety of semantics of video contents. In the hashing stage, we represent each video component as a compact hash code, and combine multiple hash codes into hash tables for effective search. To speed up the retrieval while retaining most informative codes, we propose a graph-based influence maximization method to bridge the pooling and hashing stages. We show that the influence maximization problem is submodular, which allows a greedy optimization method to achieve a nearly optimal solution. Our method works very efficiently, retrieving thousands of video clips from TRECVID dataset in about 0.001 second. For a larger scale synthetic dataset with 1M samples, it uses less than 1 second in response to 100 queries. Our method is extensively evaluated in both unsupervised and supervised scenarios, and the results on TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection and Columbia Consumer Video datasets demonstrate the success of our proposed technique.</td><td>List(List(53f45b6edabfaedd74e40a82, null, null, 5b869b4fe1cd8e14a393fd2e, Liangliang Cao, null, null, null, null, IBM Watson Research Center, Hawthorne, NY, USA, null, 5f71b5c41c455f439fe532ea, null, null, null), List(54054d47dabfae450f3a27d1, null, null, 5b86a6d6e1cd8e14a3dfe6f4, Zhenguo Li, null, null, null, null, Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA, null, 5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5ab, null, null, null), List(53f46df6dabfaee2a1dcce6f, null, null, 5b86a6d6e1cd8e14a3dfe6f4, Yadong Mu, null, null, null, null, Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA, null, 5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5ab, null, null, null), List(53f49da0dabfaebfa777b6e1, null, null, 5b86a6d6e1cd8e14a3dfe6f4, Shih-Fu Chang, null, null, null, null, Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA, null, 5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5ab, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1145/2393347.2393393</td><td>List(Locality-sensitive hashing, Data mining, Double hashing, Computer science, Universal hashing, Feature hashing, Artificial intelligence, Hash function, Machine learning, Dynamic perfect hashing, Open addressing, Hash table)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>List(video clip, efficient large-scale video retrieval, hash code, graph-based influence maximization method, submodular video, compact hash code, video content, hash table, unified framework, greedy optimization method, video frame, video component, indexing, submodular)</td><td>en</td><td>52</td><td>308</td><td>299</td><td>//static.aminer.org/pdf/20170130/pdfs/mm/d5lckv3d0pre6wfxjrenlkygum9op1ig.pdf</td><td>List(53e99bf0b7602d970249e152, 53e9a33db7602d9702c4932e, 53e9a7ebb7602d970312da69, 558bb5bfe4b00c3c48de0a4f, 53e9a12ab7602d9702a1ca94, 53e997fcb7602d97020083d9, 53e9aeddb7602d9703905979, 558b016c84ae84d265c0ee86, 53e99d81b7602d970263eaa8, 53e9a0f3b7602d97029dc1f7, 558bc45ae4b00c3c48de5a0f, 53e9bc6eb7602d97048ea570, 53e9b88bb7602d970445be1a, 53e99bb9b7602d9702463373, 53e99e94b7602d970275cb91, 558a3998e4b037c08755e0fa, 53e9a5f0b7602d9702f1bae9, 53e9a0fbb7602d97029e6239, 53e9a99cb7602d97032f707c, 53e9a358b7602d9702c670f8, 53e9a66eb7602d9702fa13c5, 53e99b1bb7602d97023adfe7, 53e9aadfb7602d97034623f3, 53e9bccbb7602d970494e4f0, 53e9b31bb7602d9703de75ab, 53e9b281b7602d9703d28e88, 53e9b055b7602d9703ab90bf, 53e9a719b7602d970305252b, 53e99c43b7602d97024f09da, 53e9ab89b7602d970353389a, 53e99d2fb7602d97025e3847, 53e9b1eab7602d9703c7f96b)</td><td>Submodular video hashing: a unified framework towards video pooling and indexing</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2393347.2393393, http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2393347.2393393, https://static.aminer.org/pdf/20170130/pdfs/index.txt)</td><td>List(53a72e0620f7420be8c7c642, null, null, ACM Multimedia, null, null, null, ACM Multimedia 2001, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2012</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a5a2b</td><td>The paper presents a novel derivation of the average au- tocorrelation and the average power spectrum for Markov renewal processes.

On the contrary, search semantic is to find the information about the person in the real world. It is hard to achieve this goal in current content based web search engines because text is not useful during inference. The semantic web brings semantic to current web with formalized knowledge and data that computers can process. Therefore search can be benefit from the inference which is supported by ontology. In this paper, we propose a novel method to enhance the search semantic using ontology language DAML+OIL. Experiment shows preferable results comparing to the traditional search.

In this paper we propose an enhanced version of the IEEE 802.11 DCF that employs an estimator of the number of competing terminals based on a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) or a approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach. The algorithm uses a Bayesian framework, optimizing the backoff parameters of the DCF based on the predictive distribution of the num- ber of competing terminals. We show that our algorithm is simple yet highly accurate even at small time scales. We implement our proposed new DCF in the ns-2 simulator and show that it outperforms existing methods. We also show that its accuracy can be used to improve the results of the protocol even when the nodes are not in saturation mode.</td><td>List(List(53f4507edabfaec09f1eff1a, null, null, 5b86af92e1cd8e14a318b0f1, Alberto Lopez, null, null, null, null, Department of Electrical Engineering|Columbia University|Epidaure Research Group, null, 5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5ab, null, null, null), List(54093dbadabfae8faa678f8f, null, null, 5b86af92e1cd8e14a318b0f1, Tom Vercauteren, null, null, null, null, Department of Electrical Engineering|Columbia University|Epidaure Research Group, null, 5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5ab, null, null, null), List(53f58f25dabfaedb01f8047b, null, null, 5b86af92e1cd8e14a318b0f1, Xiaodong Wang, null, null, null, null, Department of Electrical Engineering|Columbia University|Epidaure Research Group, null, 5f71b2811c455f439fe3c5ab, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1109/ICASSP.2005.1416458</td><td>List(Mathematical optimization, Monte Carlo method, IEEE 802.11, Computer science, Particle filter, Distributed coordination function, Bayesian framework, Maximum a posteriori estimation, Estimator, Bayesian probability)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>List(Bayes methods, IEEE standards, Monte Carlo methods, maximum likelihood estimation, optimisation, protocols, state estimation, wireless LAN, Bayesian estimators, DCF, IEEE 802.11 protocol, MAP estimation, approximate maximum a posteriori estimation, backoff parameters, competing terminals, distributed coordination function, network state, ns-2 simulator, optimization mechanisms, predictive distribution, saturation mode, sequential Monte Carlo estimation)</td><td>en</td><td>5</td><td>936</td><td>933</td><td>https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/2046/200/144/53e99967b7602d97021a5e73_0.pdf</td><td>List(558a6cab84ae84d265bd8722, 53e9b3c7b7602d9703eb2a42, 53e9ab64b7602d97034fdaf4, 53e9b2f0b7602d9703dac4a4)</td><td>OPTIMIZING IEEE 802.11 DCF USING BAYESIAN ESTIMATORS OF THE NETWORK STATE</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2005.1416458, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1416458)</td><td>List(53a724e220f7420be8b3d1aa, null, null, null, null, null, null, ICASSP, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>5</td><td>2005</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a5a5a</td><td>Cooperative networks allow the nodes relaying each other's messages to enhance the transmission reliability over wireless fading channels by achieving cooperative diversity. Among the various relaying protocols, the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy is well studied for its simplicity. However, to collect the cooperative diversity, there are two main issues that the AF protocol is facing. One is that the channel state information (CSI) of the source-to-relay link (i.e., two-hop CSI) is needed at the destination. The other concern is that the power scaling factor (PSF) and output signals at the relay are unbounded. These two issues make AF less practical in resource constrained networks, e.g., blind and peak power constrained relays. In this paper, we reveal the necessary and sufficient conditions on designing the PSF for the maximum ratio combining (MRC) receiver at the destination with two-hop (TH) CSI to achieve full cooperative diversity. Furthermore, we also provide the necessary conditions on the PSF design so that MRC with only one-hop (OH) CSI still collects full cooperative diversity. These designs make AF strategies more general and practical. The theoretical analysis is corroborated by numerical simulations.</td><td>List(List(53f442f2dabfaee43ec7138b, null, null, 5b86c96ee1cd8e14a3d31511, Qijia Liu, null, null, null, null, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA, null, 5f71b4f61c455f439fe4dc1a, null, null, null), List(53f4b8f6dabfaed83b77b422, null, null, 5b86c96ee1cd8e14a3d31511, Wei Zhang, null, null, null, null, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA, null, 5f71b4f61c455f439fe4dc1a, null, null, null), List(54487e62dabfae87b7e32172, null, null, 5b86c96ee1cd8e14a3d31511, Xiaoli Ma, null, null, null, null, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA, null, 5f71b4f61c455f439fe4dc1a, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462022</td><td>List(Wireless fading channel, Computer science, Maximal-ratio combining, Fading, Cooperative diversity, Signal-to-noise ratio, Computer network, Relay, Bit error rate, Channel state information)</td><td>978-1-4244-5836-3</td><td>0743-166X</td><td></td><td>List(channel state information, source-to-relay link, protocols, af strategy, relaying protocols, fading channels, psf design, two-hop csi, wireless fading channels, cooperative network, cooperative diversity, various relaying protocol, full cooperative diversity, transmission reliability, necessary condition, af protocol, peak power, power scaling factor, radio receivers, output signals, general amplify-and-forward design, maximum ratio combining receiver, amplify-and-forward design, cooperative networks, fading, decoding, fading channel, signal to noise ratio, wireless communication, numerical simulation, bit error rate, maximum ratio combining)</td><td>en</td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e99c58b7602d9702506fbc, 53e99eb5b7602d970277d5f6, 558a3baae4b037c08755ecf7, 558ab71ee4b037c08758bba1, 53e99e8bb7602d970274ff39, 53e9ad0ab7602d97036e843f, 53e9bb15b7602d9704750dda, 53e9a3bab7602d9702ccc964, 558acc71e4b037c087593865, 53e9bb22b7602d970475b82c, 558a6fdee4b037c087572201, 558a411ae4b0b32fcb35b9f6, 558a321be4b031bae1f636c1, 53e9bb93b7602d97047d841a, 53e9b808b7602d97043b9837, 53e9a691b7602d9702fc6a87, 53e9bd46b7602d97049d4aee, 53e9a6cab7602d9702ffd26a, 558a3322e4b037c08755bb2c, 53e99d29b7602d97025e14b5, 558b2afae4b031bae1fbe2aa, 53e9a3b3b7602d9702cc1dc7)</td><td>Practical and General Amplify-and-Forward Designs for Cooperative Networks</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462022, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5462022)</td><td>List(53a72b0920f7420be8c16721, null, null, International Conference on Computer Communications, null, null, null, INFOCOM, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2010</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a5a5f</td><td>ABSTRACT: Construction workspace is a dynamic environment that allows little time to obtain and update graphical and image modeling information required in construction equipment operations.

This paper presents a rapid method, by combining human-assisted graphical workspace modeling with pre-stored CAD models and simple sensors (such as single-axis laser range-finders and remote video cameras), which can significantly reduce the modeling time while potentially increasing the modeling accuracy.</td><td>List(List(53f42af2dabfaeb2acfc1f28, null, null, null, Yong-kwon Cho, null, null, null, null, Dept. of Civil Eng., Texas Univ., Austin, TX, USA, null, null, List(Dept. of Civil Eng., Texas Univ., Austin, TX, USA), null, null), List(54850544dabfae9b40133288, null, null, null, Carl T.

Varieties of biwuy tree languages are compared with varieties of tree languages studied earlier in the literature. We also prove a variety theorem thus solving a problem noted by several authors.

Unlike previous financial crisis, one major driver of this crisis is the contagious failures of banks through a network of interbank payments and correlated bank portfolios of financial products. The risk that the failure of a single bank can cause a cascading failure of other connected banks and may potentially bring down the entire banking system (network), is defined as systemic risk. Existing bank risk management research focused on the causes and impacts of systemic risk but largely ignored the monitoring and preventive mechanism. In this study, we developed a network-based algorithm to rank systemic risk of banks and financial products in the bank network.

The system uses personal computer class machines together with distributed microcontrollers linked through local area network and proprietary serial links. A real-time operating system model is installed giving the system a higher level operating system interface to the application for adaptability and ease of design.</td><td>List(List(53f39734dabfae4b34a7a11c, null, null, null, E.

We found that reflective/abstractive text significantly improved learning for students with a moderate amount of motivation. We further found that high cohesion improved learning, but only for students with a sufficiently high level of prior knowledge. We interpret these results to mean that a reflective/abstractive text can usefully improve learning after tutoring with a physics tutoring system.

Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging as a global network for connecting any objects (physical or virtual) across the globe, ranging applications from home appliances to consumer electronics. In IoT, physical objects such as home appliances, vehicles, supply-chain items, containers, etc. should have unique identities for interacting among themselves. As a result, unique identification of trillion of objects is a foremost requirement in IoT. RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) technology plays an important role in IoT for solving identification issues of objects around us in a cost effective manner. The usage of low cost RFID tags draws greater attention from researchers in recent past, as the cost of supply-chain items should not exceed much because of embedded tag cost. The communication between tag and reader takes place over insecure channel. Therefore, security concern has become an important issue in RFID systems. In recent years, several light-weight protocols and improvements have been proposed for RFID security. Some of them have succeeded with their security claim, but many protocols suffer from security weaknesses or design flaws. In this paper, we discuss a recently proposed protocol's strengths and weaknesses and then proposed an improved protocol, retaining efficiency of the protocol intact.</td><td>List(List(53f42f2bdabfaeb1a7ba21d1, null, null, 5b86c6dee1cd8e14a3c07339, Renu Aggarwal, null, null, null, null, Dhirubhai Ambani Inst. of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar, null, null, null, null, null), List(53f46decdabfaeb22f556f15, null, null, 5b86c6dee1cd8e14a3c07339, Manik Lal Das, null, null, null, null, Dhirubhai Ambani Inst. of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar, null, null, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1145/2490428.2490435</td><td>List(Authentication, Global network, Computer security, Computer science, Internet of Things, Communication channel, Electronics, Radio-frequency identification, Strengths and weaknesses, The Internet)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>List(embedded tag cost, cost effective manner, rfid security, security concern, home appliance, security claim, rfid system, supply-chain item, security weakness, low cost rfid tag, authentication, internet of things, privacy, security)</td><td>en</td><td>50</td><td>56</td><td>51</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9b4a0b7602d9703fa920c, 53e9a0bcb7602d97029a7cef, 53e9ad6cb7602d970375846c, 53e9a1a2b7602d9702a98454, 53e9a9d3b7602d970333655b, 53e99ca1b7602d970255437b, 53e9bd2ab7602d97049b7b83, 53e9a423b7602d9702d3d1ab, 53e9a6fdb7602d9703030f0a)</td><td>RFID security in the context of \"internet of things\"</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2490428.2490435, http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2490428.2490435)</td><td>List(53a7277920f7420be8b908ad, null, null, International Workshop on Security, null, null, null, SECURIT, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2012</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a5c5a</td><td>Insights from biology have helped reduce the weight and increase the climbing ability of mobile robots.

Mechanisms were designed and tested to move the spines into and out of contact with the screen. After the spine engages the substrate, springs along the leg are compressed. The opposing lateral spring forces constitute a distributed inward grip that is similar to forces measured on climbing insects and geckos. The distributed inward gripping (DIG) holds the robot on the screen, allowing it to climb vertically, walk inverted on a screen ceiling and cling passively in these orientations.</td><td>List(List(53f43463dabfaee43ec1c683, null, null, null, Gregory D.

Basic LOTOS is the version of LOTOS without value-passing. A widely used approach to the verification of temporal properties is model checking. Often, in this approach the formal specification is translated into a labeled transition system on which formulae expressing properties are checked. A problem with this verification technique is state explosion: concurrent systems are often represented by automata with a prohibitive number of states. In this paper we show how, given a set rho of actions, it is possible to automatically obtain for a Basic LOTOS program a reduced transition system to which only the arcs labeled by actions in rho belong. The set rho of actions plays a fundamental role in conjunction with a temporal logic defined by the authors in a previous paper: selective mu-calculus. The reduced system with respect to rho preserves the truth value of all selective mu-calculus formulae with actions from the set rho. We act at both syntactic and semantic levels. From a syntactic point of view, we define a set of transformation rules obtaining a smaller program.

Autism-relevant phenotypes in the inbred mouse strain BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) offer translational tools to discover biological mechanisms underlying unusual mouse behaviors analogous to symptoms of autism. Two of the most consistent findings with BTBR are lack of sociability as measured by the three-chamber social approach task and increased amount of time engaged in self-grooming in an empty cage. Here we evaluated BTBR as compared to two typical inbred strains with high sociability and low self-grooming, C57BL/6J (B6) and FVB/AntJ (FVB), on both the automated three-chambered social approach task and repetitive self-grooming assays. Brains from the behaviorally tested mice were analyzed using magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging to investigate potential neuroanatomical abnormalities throughout the brain; specifically, to discover neuroanatomical mechanisms which could explain the autism-relevant behavioral abnormalities. Significant differences in volume and white matter microstructure were detected in multiple anatomical regions throughout the brain of BTBR compared to B6 and FVB. Further, significant correlations were found between behavioral measures and areas of the brain known to be associated with those behaviors. For example, striatal volume was strongly correlated to time spent in self-grooming across strains. Our findings suggest that neuropathology exists in BTBR beyond the previously reported white matter abnormalities in the corpus callosum and hippocampal commissure and that these brain differences may be related to the behavioral abnormalities seen in BTBR.</td><td>List(List(53f31f19dabfae9a8444b431, null, jacob@phenogenomics.ca, null, Jacob Ellegood, null, null, null, null, Mouse Imaging Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada, null, null, List(Mouse Imaging Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada, Corresponding author at: Mouse Imaging Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, 25 Orde Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5T 3H7.

Our method is computationally efficient enough to handle large sequences and is flexible enough to account for influencing factors, such as sequence-composition biases both at the seed detection and alignment levels.http://wwwabi.snv.jussieu.fr/public/RepSeek/</td><td>List(List(53f47132dabfaee43ed20bc3, null, achaz@abi.snv.jussieu.fr, 5b86a295e1cd8e14a3c544ce, Guillaume Achaz, null, null, null, null, Atelier de Bioinformatique, Université Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6  12, rue Cuvier, 75005 Paris, France, null, 5f71b3641c455f439fe428c8, null, null, null), List(53f47762dabfaee43ed3920d, null, null, 5b86a70ae1cd8e14a3e13f8c, Frédéric Boyer, null, null, null, 0000-0003-0021-9590, INRIA-Rhône Alpes projet HELIX, 655, avenue de l'Europe, Montbonnot  38334 Saint Ismier Cedex, France, null, 5f71b3c31c455f439fe4521f, null, null, null), List(53f4467adabfaedf435ccacb, null, null, 5b86a295e1cd8e14a3c544ce, Eduardo P C Rocha, null, null, null, null, Atelier de Bioinformatique, Université Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6  12, rue Cuvier, 75005 Paris, France, null, 5f71b3641c455f439fe428c8, null, null, null), List(541062c2dabfae92b427ba62, null, null, 5b86a70ae1cd8e14a3e13f8c, Alain Viari, null, null, null, null, INRIA-Rhône Alpes projet HELIX, 655, avenue de l'Europe, Montbonnot  38334 Saint Ismier Cedex, France, null, 5f71b3c31c455f439fe4521f, null, null, null), List(53f4380edabfaee0d9b7433f, null, null, 5b86a70ae1cd8e14a3e13f8c, Eric Coissac, null, null, null, 0000-0001-7507-6729, INRIA-Rhône Alpes projet HELIX, 655, avenue de l'Europe, Montbonnot  38334 Saint Ismier Cedex, France, null, 5f71b3c31c455f439fe4521f, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1093/bioinformatics/btl519</td><td>List(Chromosome, Biology, Theoretical computer science, Software, DNA sequencing, Computational biology, Indel)</td><td></td><td>1367-4811</td><td>1</td><td>List(approximate repeat, coherent statistical framework, seed detection, two-steps method, long dna sequence, alignment level, large dna sequence, sequence-composition bias, large sequence, efficient method, large dna, dna sequence)</td><td>en</td><td>70</td><td>121</td><td>119</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9a8aab7602d97031fac5e, 53e9bdceb7602d9704a80254, 53e9a9f7b7602d970335f047, 53e9bdfdb7602d9704aafd75, 53e9a3fbb7602d9702d12d4a)</td><td>Repseek, a tool to retrieve approximate repeats from large DNA sequences.</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btl519, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17038345?report=xml&format=text, http://www.webofknowledge.com/)</td><td>List(53a002f0831432abcb742bb3, null, null, null, null, null, null, Bioinformatics, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td>23</td><td>2007</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a5c77</td><td>We study the behavior of the minimal sets of a sequence of convex sets $ \\left\\{ A_{n}\\right\\} $ converging to a given set $A.$ The main feature of the present work is the use of convexity properties of the sets $A_{n}$ and $ A$ to obtain upper and lower convergence of the minimal frontiers.

For those modern real-time systems, the limitations of original static Response Time Analysis (RTA) become more and more conspicuous. Most static analysis methods not only require much detailed system information, but also only target to some specific system model with non-realistic assumptions. As a result, those methods may produce overly pessimistic results, making them unsuitable to be applied on a complex industrial system. The best system model may be the system itself. Therefore, statistical RTA, which can produce probabilistic analysis results based on samples provided by real systems or simulators, may become more expedient. Statistical RTA usually requires more relaxed assumptions and less system information than static RTA. In this paper, we present an Extreme Value Theory (EVT) based method to compute Worst-Case Response Time (WCRT) targeting complex real-time systems. In the evaluation phase, we have applied this method to the calculation of worst-case transmission delays of messages over Controller Area Network (CAN), and some comparisons with static RTA are also provided.

The possible benefits of Web 2.0 are great, but it seems that without timely and prompt action disabled users will be barred from these benefits. Indeed, using sites such as: Flicker, YouTube, MySpace, Google Maps, and Google Portal will rapidly become 'offlimits' to disabled users. Semantic Web technologies have already shown themselves to be useful in addressing some issues of Web Accessibility. However, this new technology has not yet started to make its way into mainstream applications. Without change, will the benefits of the Semantic Web be lost? Will the promising enhanced interactivity of Web 2.0 technologies become increasingly inaccessible to disabled users? We pose the question: \"Web 2.0 and the Semantic Web: Hindrance or Opportunity?\" The conference was held on Monday the 7th and Tuesday the 8th of May 2007 at the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel in Banff National Park. We welcomed 65 attendees pursuing research on Web accessibility. We accepted 40.3% of all submissions, each paper was peer reviewed by the three of our programme committee. In brief, the conference proceedings brought together a cross section of Web design, engineering and Web accessibility research. The papers included report on developments on the Web 2.0 and Semantic Web, discussed the issues regarding the evolvement of the Web, and suggested cross-pollinated solutions.

In this paper, we extend this architectural model to encompass UI-enabled devices, thereby enabling it to cover human-to-application conversations as well. This permits either participant to be human-driven, automated, or anywhere in between, without affecting the nature of the interaction or of the other participant. The UI-enabled conversational model also reduces the difficulty of developing conversational applications, providing significant benefits both for UI and for application developers. We describe the architecture of a UI-enabled conversational system that supports a variety of user devices, and includes a means by which UI markup may be automatically generated from the conversational protocols used. We go through a sample application currently implemented using a commercially available application server, and further describe a graphical tool for editing and testing conversational protocols, that significantly eases the protocol development process.</td><td>List(List(54088149dabfae450f42246a, null, null, null, James E.

Although it is a dynamic and naturally engaging subject there are significant barriers which make it difficult for a student to engage realistically with network protocols. These can be categorised as barriers of time, space and access. From the perspective of time, many of the interactions occur at timescales that are outside of the range of human perception; from the perspective of space, a student will be situated in one location which will often define their view of the network; from the perspective of access, interaction with network protocols is mediated through libraries provided by operating systems which in turn require the use of programming languages to manipulate.

Using the dynamic model, a global and comprehensive dynamic performance index (GCDPI) is proposed to evaluate the manipulator capabilities in terms of dynamic manipulability and dexterity in the prescribed task space. The dynamic optimization problem, which aims at providing the largest, the most isotropic and the most uniform dynamic manipulability of the 2-DoF TPM in the task space, is formulated as the minimization of GCDPI subjected to a set of appropriate constraints. Optimization results showed that the dynamic manipulability of the 2-DoF TPM with optimized kinematic and inertial parameters improves greatly in the prescribed task space. The dynamic equations are also incorporated in the hardware in the loop simulation of the 2-DoF TPM and experimental results show the tracking errors of the linear motor can be improved greatly when a nonlinear computed torque feedforward controller is implemented in addition to the cascade position controller.</td><td>List(List(5602423445cedb3395f4cb90, null, null, 5b86a6ffe1cd8e14a3e0f853, Gang Zhang, null, null, null, null, State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration, School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, null, 5f71b54b1c455f439fe502b0, null, null, null), List(53f44861dabfaedce557f686, null, null, 5b86a6ffe1cd8e14a3e0f853, PinKuan Liu, null, null, null, null, State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration, School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, null, 5f71b54b1c455f439fe502b0, null, null, null), List(542ac5e7dabfae61d49a5978, null, null, 5b86a6ffe1cd8e14a3e0f853, Han Ding, null, null, null, null, State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration, School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, null, 5f71b54b1c455f439fe502b0, null, null, null))</td><td>10.1007/978-3-642-33515-0_11</td><td>List(Parallel manipulator, Control theory, Kinematics, Nonlinear system, Jacobian matrix and determinant, Control theory, Computer science, Control engineering, Hardware-in-the-loop simulation, Optimization problem, Dynamic simulation)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>List(dynamic optimization problem, dynamic model, 2-dof tpm, dynamic analysis, 2-dof translational parallel manipulator, dynamic equation, uniform dynamic manipulability, dynamic manipulability, new performance index, comprehensive dynamic performance index, prescribed task space)</td><td>en</td><td>2</td><td>115</td><td>103</td><td>null</td><td>List(53e9b65bb7602d97041b8970, 557d9b6bf6678c77ea21bb21, 53e99b77b7602d970241cad3, 53e9a627b7602d9702f59501, 53e9afbab7602d9703a09053)</td><td>Dynamic optimization with a new performance index for a 2-dof translational parallel manipulator</td><td>List(http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-33515-0_11)</td><td>List(5550376b7cea80f954187366, null, null, International Conference on Intelligent Robotics and Applications, null, null, null, ICIRA, null, null, null, null, 0)</td><td></td><td>2012</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>53e99967b7602d97021a6009</td><td>The viability of the application of the e-Institution paradigm for obtaining overall desired behavior in open multiagent systems\n"," (MAS) lies in the possibility of bringing the norms of the institution to have an actual impact on the MAS.

Background: Iconic signals, such as a cough to signal dangerous levels of carbon monoxide, convey information about the nature of an incident and alert the operator that there is a problem, whereas signals that are arbitrarily associated with a critical incident provide relatively less information. Warning recognition speed and accuracy are likely to be influenced by modality of presentation (visual, auditory, auditory + visual) and task demand (low, high). Methods: The 172 participants completed a computer-based training session and test task that involved responding to abstract or iconic auditory (1s), visual, or auditory + visual warnings associated with seven critical incidents while performing low- and high-demand concurrent tasks. Results: Significantly fewer training trials were required to learn iconic warnings than abstract warnings. An advantage for iconic warnings persisted into the test phase, evident most consistently as greater warning recognition accuracy. The effect was observed in both high- and low-demand conditions. Auditory abstract warnings, in particular, elicited slow reaction times and poor accuracy. Conclusion: Associations between a small number of meaningful environmental sounds and critical incidents can be learned with ease relative to more abstract associations, although training is required and response times are relatively slow. Application: Sets of distinctive auditory iconic warnings can be designed to alert and inform pilots about non-time-pressured events. Potential applications of language-neutral icons as informative warnings include civil, commercial, and defense aircraft.</td><td>List(List(53f383a3dabfae4b34a05024, null, null, null, Nathan C.

However, RCA has two important disadvantages. One is the lack of exploiting negative constraints which can also be informative, and the other is its incapability of capturing complex nonlinear relationships between data instances with the contextual information. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to overcome these two disadvantages, i.e., Discriminative Component Analysis (DCA) and Kernel DCA. Compared with other complicated methods for distance metric learning, our algorithms are rather simple to understand and very easy to solve. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms on image retrieval in which experimental results show that our algorithms are effective and promising in learning good quality distance metrics for image retrieval.</td><td>List(List(562cf9b445cedb3398d1a1e4, null, null, null, Steven C.

Over a two-year period we collected field study data from multiple samples of information systems project teams-in all, 52 virtual teams comprising 318 students from the United States, Great Britain, and Hong Kong. As we hypothesized, group potency and computer collective efficacy act as antecedents to virtual team efficacy, and virtual team efficacy is in turn predictive of perceptual and objective measures of performance. Further, consistent with efficacy theory, we also find that virtual team efficacy acts on performance outcomes through specific mediating processes. This paper contributes to the academic and practitioner communities by providing a comprehensive model of virtual team efficacy and performance and by providing validated instrumentation that can be immediately applied during further research in this area.</td><td>List(List(53f46aa1dabfaeee22a6370e, null, null, null, Mark A.
